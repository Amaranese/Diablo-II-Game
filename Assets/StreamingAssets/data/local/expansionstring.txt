A4Q2ExpansionSuccessTyrael	40}Praise be to the Light! You have }accomplished the impossible!} }Diablo and Mephisto have been }banished back into the Black Abyss }that spawned them, and the corrupted }Soulstones are no more.} }However, while you were fighting here, }Baal remained behind in the mortal }realm, building an army of hellish }minions. Now, Baal's army is searching }for the Worldstone, the ancient source }of all the Soulstones and their power, }while leaving behind a wake of }destruction. They have forged deeply }into the Barbarian homelands, heading }directly for the summit of Mount }Arreat!} }Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the }very site of the blessed Worldstone!} }Now, enter the portal I have opened for }you. It will take you to the Barbarian }city of Harrogath, the last bastion of }Order on the slopes of Arreat.}
A4Q2ExpansionSuccessCain	40}I knew there was great potential in you, }my friend. You've done a fantastic job.} }Though my ancestors often struggled }against the Three Evils and their }minions, I've always lived a shut-in, }scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom }aided you.} }Now, I wish to leave this place. Though }Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, }I hope I won't have to see them again }for many, many years.} }Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this }place now!}
AncientsAct5IntroGossip1	35}We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the }Ancient Ones. We have been chosen to }guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein }the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy }to stand in its presence; fewer still can }comprehend its true purpose.} }Before you enter, you must defeat us.}
CainAct5IntroGossip1	39}I am amazed to find this place so }untouched. Everything else in the path }of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in }ruin. } }These Barbarians must indeed be the }legendary guardians of Mount Arreat. }They are a proud, hardy people. Don't }expect to be greeted warmly -- }strangers here rarely are.} }Perhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend }some time with the townsfolk and try }to understand them better. I'll let you }know what I discover.}
CainAct5Gossip1	52}With hellspawn, size is no measure of }their threat. Demons half the size of }men can kill with a gesture, while }hellish pack animals trample any who }stand in their way.}
CainAct5Gossip2	55}Though these Barbarians are known }throughout the kingdoms as ferocious }fighters, they are also capable of great }compassion.} }They have trained throughout history }for a battle their legends foretell will }decide the fate of the world.}
CainAct5Gossip3	55}The angel Tyrael has watched over the }guardians of Arreat throughout }history. I do not believe that Baal and }Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry }few souls.} }They are here to settle a conflict as old }as time itself.}
CainAct5Gossip4	44}During my time with the Horadrim, we }often debated the nature of Mount }Arreat.} }We knew that the Barbarian clans }zealously guarded the mountain as }their sacred duty. However, many }dismissed their zeal as simple }superstition...combined with an inborn }hostility toward outsiders.} }Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat }were never heard from again...Still, I }do not believe they died at the hands of }Barbarians.}
CainAct5Gossip5	41}All users of the magical arts know of }Mount Arreat, but few understand its }true nature. It is the nexus of an }unfathomable magic.} }It bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction }races to its summit with such purpose. }I fear for the whole world should Baal }gain what he seeks.}
CainAct5Gossip6	59}I have spent decades trying to }understand the forces at work in this }world. But in the face of all that is }transpiring, I realize how meager my }knowledge is.} }I will be of assistance where I can, my }friend.}
CainAct5Gossip7	54}Though the Elder Council of Harrogath }is gone, there are many capable young }leaders to take their place.} }Anya certainly has enough courage and }intelligence to lead them all, if they can }survive this catastrophe.}
CainAct5Gossip8	53}Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of }feminine strength...} }She reminds me of the Zakarum }priestesses I knew in my youth. They }don't take vows of chastity, you know.}
CainAct5Gossip9	65}It is fortunate that this town has such a }talented smith.} }The quality of Larzuk's work surely }complements your skills. In fact, he }would have been quite welcome }amongst the Horadrim.}
CainAct5Gossip10	54}It is my belief that the Soulstones are at }the center of this conflict. If only that }fool Marius had not intervened, Baal }would still be imprisoned within Tal }Rasha.}
AnyaAct5IntroGossip1	54}You have proven yourself a true hero to }me and my people.} }These are dark times, warrior. I hope }you can bring an end to Baal's reign of }destruction. } }Our Council of Elders is gone -- my }father, Aust, among them. The one }thing that keeps us from total despair }is the promise of vengeance against }Baal.}
AnyaGossip1	45}Now that the Elders are all dead, I don't }know who will guide our people through }this dark time. I was to be next in line }after my father, but this burden is too }great for me to shoulder alone. } }We are a people of strong blood. I shall }do what I can and let fate do the rest.}
AnyaGossip2	82}Baal's minions are not to be trifled with. }In their bloodlust they will sacrifice }themselves to destroy you.}
AnyaGossip3	60}Many outsiders believe that the }fantastic stories about our ancestors, }the Ancients, are but fables. However, I }believe that the Ancients were more }than human -- that mankind has fallen }from what it once was.}
AnyaGossip4	58}When I was a child, the Elders told us }stories about the mountain and its }power...and how the Barbarian people }are bound to it as protectors.} }Baal is not just taking our land -- with }every step he takes up the mountain, }he takes a part of who we are as a }people.}
AnyaGossip5	72}I am truly glad you are here, warrior. }Perhaps things would be different now }if we had asked for assistance from }the neighboring kingdoms.} }Our foolish, foolish pride...}
AnyaGossip6	54}My father, Aust, was among those }Elders wise enough to see that we }would need outside help to deal with }Baal's legions. He believed that this }conflict would affect the entire world, }not just our homeland. He said that }Mount Arreat is as necessary to the }world's survival as food and water is to }our own.} }I believe this to be true.}
AnyaGossip7	50}Qual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities }once bordered on arrogance, but in the }early days of the siege, he was }humbled by Baal. While he saved us }from immediate destruction, a third of }our warriors were lost.} }None felt those losses more than he. }Though he may not admit it, your }presence gives him hope, warrior.}
AnyaGossip8	78}If Larzuk could sing or dance half as }well as he smiths, he'd be married by }now.} }...Just look at those shoulders.}
AnyaGossip9	57}Nihlathak was the last of our Elders, }whose charge it was to safeguard the }mountain. He alone tried to guide us }through the most desperate time in our }history -- but he was just as helpless as }the rest of us.} }I cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can }learn from it.}
AnyaGossip10	60}Our people believe that the Ancients }protecting Mount Arreat have the }power to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the }Lord of Destruction has shown great }power to undermine our faith.}
LarzukAct5IntroGossip1	55}I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors }were some of the finest craftsmen in }Harrogath. } }Regretfully, my supplies run lower with }every passing day, yet the demons }beyond the walls have not weakened. } }I fear the time is near when I must put }down my hammer and take up a sword, }instead.}
LarzukAct5IntroAmaGossip1	42}So, you're an Amazon. I have heard }rumors about your kind. Your unusual }weapons could prove a challenge to my }skills, but I'm prepared to meet it.} }I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors }were some of the finest craftsmen in }Harrogath. Regretfully, my supplies run }lower with every passing day, yet the }demons beyond the walls have not }weakened. I fear the time is near when }I must put down my hammer and take }up a sword, instead.}
LarzukGossip1	65}I've heard that you Amazons excel at }killing from a distance. From what I've }seen, that's the best way to deal with }Hell's minions. } }Are all of your kind so...big?}
LarzukGossip2	65}Why did you ever leave your beautiful }islands to come to this frozen }battleground? Perhaps if we both }survive this, we'll travel back there }together.}
LarzukGossip3	75}Has that infernal howling been keeping }you awake at night, too? Some think }it's the howling of animals, but those }sounds don't come from any beast I've }ever known.}
LarzukGossip4	69}Demonic forces have been using our }own towers and barricades against us. }You know, it would be wise to cut the }demons down in the open before they }can mount those fortifications.}
LarzukGossip5	70}Nihlathak's despair is infectious -- and }his behavior does not befit an Elder of }his stature. I think we'd be better off }without him.}
LarzukGossip6	63}I've offered Qual-Kehk my ideas on how }to break the siege, but he dismisses }them. Is it because I lack scars of }battle, or does he think I'm a couple }arrows short of a quiver?}
LarzukGossip7	64}Legend has it that the top of Mount }Arreat is guarded by the spirits of our }ancestors. Though our people are }forbidden to climb to the mountain's }summit, some foreign travelers have }made the attempt.} }None have ever returned.}
LarzukGossip8	66}This is a lively town during our victory }celebrations. We Barbarians train long }and hard from childhood to become }warriors, and we celebrate with equal }fervor.} }You didn't happen to bring along any }ale to trade?}
LarzukGossip9	54}Every day, one of my friends dies }fighting outside the town walls, while I }tend my anvil here unscathed. If only }we didn't need weapons so badly, I }could be out doing my share of the }fighting. } }Good luck to you, warrior.}
LarzukGossip10	56}Just so you know...The gold you pay me }doesn't line my pockets. Much of it }goes to buy the raw metal I need to }melt down for weapons and armor. The }rest -- well, all I can spare -- goes to }Malah and Qual-Kehk for other }supplies.}
MalahAct5IntroGossip1	35}I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, }the last stronghold of Order on Mount }Arreat. You have come to the right }place if you intend to defeat Baal the }Lord of Destruction.} }Baal has laid waste to our mountain }and its denizens.

If }Nihlathak is curt with you, it is because }he feels responsible for our situation. }He does not relish sending more of our }people out to die.} }So much has changed since you left }that I see little hope for us in this life.} }If you need healing or a potion, please }come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, }armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite }his disposition, may be of some }assistance with other wares.

MalahGossip1	53}I'm aware of the amazing magical }powers a Sorceress can channel. If we }survive Baal's wrath, I would be most }honored if you could demonstrate and }perhaps teach me something of what }you know. } }I may be old, but I'm not dead.}
MalahGossip2	42}I know you and my son, Bannuk, did not }part on the best of terms. He did not }understand the wanderlust that drove }you to leave your homeland. However, }even though Bannuk could never admit }it to me, as he grew older I could see }that same desire in his eyes.} }Oh...It's a pity I didn't encourage him to }go with you. He might still be alive }today.}
MalahGossip3	57}Though once considered shelter by our }people, the Ice Caves offer no refuge }from the dark horde. There are }creatures there that will freeze your }heart before feasting upon it.}
MalahGossip4	107}On the battlefield, turning your back on }even the dead is unwise.}
MalahGossip5	60}This battle plays mind tricks on our }warriors. Those fortunate enough to }have returned from the mountainside }claim to have seen angels in flight.} }Fly they might, but that certainly does }not make them angels.}
MalahGossip6	53}Perhaps you have heard the accounts }of my son's horrible death at the hands }of Baal's minions. He was my last living }child...} }The oath of compassion I have taken as }a healer extends only to humankind.} }Cut them down, warrior. All of them!}
MalahGossip7	78}The catapults are infernal machines }made of demon flesh fused with steel.} }Be wary of them.}
MalahGossip8	60}Qual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the }losses have borne heavily upon him. He }is only impatient because he judges the }worth of a warrior by action, not }words.} }You must prove yourself worthy of his }trust.}
MalahGossip9	52}Larzuk possesses a good soul, but at }times his mind seems quite unsound. } }He once asked me for twenty of my }finest sheepskins. He said he would fill }them with hot air and float like a cloud }above the battlefield to spy on Baal's }legions! } }I worry the siege has driven him mad.}
MalahGossip10	90}Be cautious, warrior.} }Though I am an experienced healer, }resurrection is beyond my powers.}
MalahGossip11	53}I pray for the day when the fields are }covered in snow unstained by the blood }of our own. Perhaps that day will come }soon...Perhaps never...} }Oh...But I forget myself. How may I aid }your quest?}
MalahGossip12	64}Your gold is most helpful. Medical }supplies for our wounded are scarce }and very expensive.} }When we can find a supplier, oh, we }must pay dearly for what we need.}
MalahGossip13	44}With the exception of Qual-Kehk, the }townspeople do not see what I see -- }the massacre we face.} }Our bravest, strongest heroes hobble }back to me begging for help. I do what }I can -- healing and bandaging some, }preparing the others for what lies }beyond.}
NihlathakAct5IntroGossip1	43}Well, well. The siege has everything in }short supply...except fools. } }Why would you seek this place, }stranger? Are you a vulture come to }loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? } }Regardless, this is no place to make a }name for yourself. The mountain is }ours to protect.

NihlathakAct5IntroNecGossip1	45}Ahhh, a Necromancer.} }While I admire your courage in seeking }out the darker side of magic, we really }have little need of your skills. The }battle will turn soon enough without }your meddling. } }Yet, I should have expected to see your }kind here. You are like a moth to the }flame -- drawn to all this death. It }feeds you in more ways than one, does }it not?}
NihlathakGossip1	49}If you're looking for cases of }treacherous magic, Assassin, take a }hard look at Larzuk. He was the only }one in town who escaped the Red Fever }last spring. He claimed his good }fortune was due to 'hand washing' }before meals.} }Hmmm...Very suspicious...}
NihlathakGossip2	48}Why would you seek this place, }stranger? Are you a vulture come to }loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? } }Regardless, this is no place to make a }name for yourself. The mountain is }ours to protect. It is only a matter of }time before Hell's legions are routed.}
NihlathakGossip3	67}Qual-Kehk is useless. He has blindly }sent our warriors to their deaths, }assuming Baal's legions would fight as }men do. Of course, everyone knows }they do not.}
NihlathakGossip4	57}The demon hordes have grown powerful }beyond measure, aided by our foolish }mistakes. But I may have found a way }to correct those mistakes...}
NihlathakGossip5	37}Oh yes...I remember our warriors as }children. Malah would set their broken }bones and give them powders for their }fevers. Now, they return to her with }wounds that will never heal.} }I am tired...Please...leave me.}
NihlathakGossip6	133}If you have nothing useful for me, be on }your way!}
NihlathakGossip7	81}Anya's father was my good friend. }There are so many to mourn...I have }no time for you!}
NihlathakGossip8	53}I have long been criticized, but }especially of late -- since the deaths of }my fellow Elders. Through it all, I have }learned one thing. Each man must do }what's right, no matter what others }may think.}
NihlathakGossip9	65}The Council of Elders always believed }itself prepared for the coming of the }Three. Obviously, we were not prepared }enough.}
QualKehkAct5IntroGossip1	45}I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms }of Harrogath.} }You have the look of a warrior...An }extra soldier will be useful.

QualKehkAct5IntroPalGossip1	42}A Paladin! I have long heard of your }people.} }As a young warrior I even considered }the pilgrimage to Kurast. But I was }younger then and foolish.

QualKehkGossip1	67}It would be an honor to have a warrior }of the Light fighting side-by-side with }my men.} }I can see your faith gives you great }strength, Paladin, but don't expect it to }keep you out of harm's way.}
QualKehkGossip2	61}Harrogath has great need of your }powers, noble Druid. However, in the }face of this supernatural onslaught, }are your natural powers up to the }task?}
QualKehkGossip3	44}The death of Malah's son was a great }tragedy. He was our finest archer.} }While leading a successful campaign }against Baal's forces, he was impaled }on a demon's spear. The wound was }such that...Well, even Malah herself }acknowledges that quick death was a }blessing.}
QualKehkGossip4	57}We have lost many well-trained warriors }to Baal's siege machines. Their range is }great. Though, they are vulnerable if }you close the distance quickly enough.}
QualKehkGossip5	96}Baal's legions seem countless, but }slaying their commanders takes some }of the fight out of them.}
QualKehkGossip6	58}Early on, parties of our best scouts }were ambushed by demons that }spawned from the very air around }them. Survivors often mentioned a }strange creature floating in the }distance.} }Perhaps taking it down could prevent }some nasty surprises.}
QualKehkGossip7	57}This is unlike any battle I have ever }fought. While we ration food and }water, the demon hordes feast nightly }on the flesh and blood of our dead.}
QualKehkGossip8	48}Larzuk is a talented blacksmith, but his }head is full of some strange ideas. } }Just the other day he came to me with a }plan to break the siege. He wanted to }fill large pipes with exploding powders }and steel balls, then...Well, like I said, }strange.}
QualKehkGossip9	46}Our Elders were wise leaders in more }peaceful times, but now the survival of }our people has fallen to me. My men }and I will fight to the death, but there's }no way to ensure the outcome.} }I used to believe that nothing could }break through our guard and assault }the holy mountain. I know now that I }was horribly mistaken.}
A5Q1InitLarzuk	45}If you're here to defeat Baal, you must }prove it!} }As we speak, Harrogath is under siege }by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death }just outside the town walls.} }Baal himself travels up the sacred }mountain, having left in charge here }one of his most vicious generals, Shenk }the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, }he lashes his own minions into suicidal }frenzies on the battlefield.} }If you wish to prove yourself to us, }destroy the monster, Shenk, that }commands those infernal catapults }outside Harrogath.  If you manage to }do this, return to me.}
A5Q1AfterInitLarzuk	150}Uh...Did I mention there were catapults?}
A5Q1AfterInitCain	83}I believe that stopping the siege on }Harrogath is the only way for you to }earn the trust of these people.}
A5Q1AfterInitAnya	84}You've proven your skill at rescuing fair }maidens...but how are you at killing }vicious beasts?}
A5Q1AfterInitMalah	77}Qual-Kehk and his men have been }fighting to break the siege for some }time. Where many have failed, you may }succeed.}
A5Q1AfterInitNihlathak	70}After so many have died, who are you }to think you can accomplish what our }proud warriors could not?}
A5Q1AfterInitQualKehk	66}About to face Shenk the Overseer and }stop the siege, are you? You should }ask Malah to perform your last rites }before you go, stranger.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnLarzuk	90}What's the matter, hero? Questioning }your fortitude? I know we are.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnCain	105}I understand your reluctance, but now }is the time to strike.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnAnya	66}Those demons have been out there }since before your arrival. Can you do }nothing to stop them?} }Your task is a simple one, warrior. Find }Shenk and destroy him.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnMalah	64}This may not be very encouraging, but }you have fared better than the others }who passed through those gates.} }In regards to Shenk the Overseer, }remember: a general is nothing without }his men.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnNihlathak	78}What are you still doing here? I thought }you were going off to die.} }Go...Be quick about it.}
A5Q1EarlyReturnQualKehk	93}So, you still live. You're either quick or a }coward.}
A5Q1SuccessfulLarzuk	63}You're an even greater warrior than I }expected...Sorry for underestimating }you.} }As a token of my appreciation, I will }craft sockets into an item of your }choosing, and from now on, you'll get }the best price for all my wares.}
A5Q1SuccessfulCain	60}Those catapults were like nothing I have }ever seen before. You have prevailed }against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is }still far ahead of you.}
A5Q1SuccessfulAnya	108}I was starting to wonder how long it }would take you to stop those beasts.} }Good job.}
A5Q1SuccessfulMalah	94}Oh...At last, the siege is ended. You }truly are an angel.} }I thank you.}
A5Q1SuccessfulNihlathak	65}Ending the siege does not earn }immediate respect, outsider.} }Respect only comes with sacrifice -- }something I'm sure you know nothing }of.}
A5Q1SuccessfulQualKehk	68}So...You managed to stop the siege.} }You are more powerful than I gave you }credit for. You have rightfully earned }my respect.}
A5Q2InitQualKehk	58}My concerns have turned to my men }taken prisoner on the battlefield by }Baal's demons. I hate to think what's }happened to them.} }As you journey up the mountain, keep }your eyes open for my soldiers and }bring them back to me if you can.}
A5Q2AfterInitQualKehk	85}Those of my men fortunate enough to }escape on their own told me that they }were held captive in the highlands and }plateaus.}
A5Q2AfterInitCain	74}I know firsthand that captivity is a sad }fate for a man. Find them quickly.}
A5Q2AfterInitAnya	85}If those men are being treated like I }was, you must find them. They won't }survive much longer.}
A5Q2AfterInitLarzuk	73}I crafted the swords and armor for }Qual-Kehk's men. They were like }brothers to me. I can't imagine the pain }they must be suffering.} }Save them if you can!}
A5Q2AfterInitMalah	84}Qual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned }for some time. They are certain to be }tired and weak.} }You must protect them once you free }them.}
A5Q2AfterInitNihlathak	94}You have proven you can take life, }warrior, but can you save it as well?}
A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehk	95}They say that discretion, not }procrastination, is the better part of }valor.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehkMan	78}More of my men are still alive out there. }I am certain of it!} }Find them. Free them from their cages }and bring them back to me.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnCain	63}If you are having trouble finding }Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to }Malah. She healed those who made it }back before. Perhaps she would have }some advice.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnAnya	115}Well, you found me on the mountain; I'm }sure you'll find them too.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnLarzuk	76}As a kid, I used to play soldier among }the barricades on the mountain. }There's no easy way through that maze }of walls.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnMalah	67}Soldiers who made it back told of a }system of barricades placed among the }mountain passes. They said that is }where the prisoners are held.}
A5Q2EarlyReturnNihlathak	52}Did you ever stop to think why these }demons are capturing Qual-Kehk's }men? Why they are attacking us? Have }you considered what Baal wants with }the mountain?} }No. You've not. You have no idea what }you are dealing with.}
A5Q2SuccessfulQualKehk	51}Thank you for rescuing my men. They }have spoken well of your bravery in }battle. Perhaps there is hope for us }after all. } }If you wish, you may hire some of my }mercenaries that you saved. And }please...take this set of runes. I had }been saving them for a socketed shield, }but I think you'll make better use of }them.} }Be sure to set them in the right order }for their fullest effect.}
A5Q2SuccessfulCain	80}You've become a hero to this town, my }friend. The shadows have lifted ever }since you brought the Light to }Harrogath.}
A5Q2SuccessfulAnya	107}I'm sure those men appreciate the }freedom you gave them...as much as I }do.}
A5Q2SuccessfulLarzuk	55}Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of }your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, }defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At }first, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm }finding them more believable with every }passing day.}
A5Q2SuccessfulMalah	73}You have inspired the people in this }town -- not only those you rescued, but }those you've helped in other ways as }well.}
A5Q2SuccessfulNihlathak	72}So. You brought the lost sheep home to }the shepherd. Well done.}
A5Q3InitMalah	43}There is a matter which I hesitate to }share, but I believe you are the only }one who can help me now.} }Anya, the young alchemist and }daughter to one of our slain Elders, }has been missing for some time. She is }a strong, crafty woman with a spirit }like no other.} }One night, just before your arrival, I }overheard her and Nihlathak arguing }about her father's death. The next }morning she was gone.} }Nihlathak has his own tale as to where }she went and why. Don't believe him! I }fear he is at the root of her }disappearance.} }Please, if you can, search for Anya and }bring her back to us. She'll know what }to do about Nihlathak.}
A5Q3AfterInitMalah	94}When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. }There is no telling what he will say or }do.}
A5Q3AfterInitCain	59}I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak }speaks with a venomous tongue and }acts as if the entire weight of this town }rests upon his shoulders.} }Perhaps there is more going on here }than we know.}
A5Q3AfterInitLarzuk	57}Anya is an amazing alchemist, }especially for her young age. As long }as I've known her, she's never let }anything stop her from pursuing what }she believed in. } }I wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is }involved. Ever since her father died, }they haven't gotten along.}
A5Q3AfterInitNihlathak	41}Anya! Who have you been talking to? }Likely it was that meddling Malah. } }Well, I'll tell you what really happened. }Anya came to me for guidance, after }receiving a vision that her mother and }younger brother were trapped in the }lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had }decided to go rescue them. } }I told her that her quest was a foolish }one and that she would be safer }staying within the city walls. However, }she is a willful girl and would not listen }to me. } }The next morning, she was gone. No }one is more distraught than I over }losing her. } }However, if you feel the need to be }Malah's errand child, I won't try to stop }you.}
A5Q3AfterInitQualKehk	43}Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest }Elder. He was killed along with the }other Elders who erected the ward that }protects this city. The ward has kept }Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at }a costly sacrifice. } }Nihlathak, on the other hand, was the }only Elder to escape the demons. }Somehow, he alone managed to find }sanctuary, while the others died }around him.} }Ever since that day, Nihlathak and Anya }have been at odds.}
A5Q3EarlyReturnMalah	52}If it were anyone else, I would assume }her dead. However, Anya is not so }easily beaten. I know she must be alive.}
A5Q3EarlyReturnCain	60}Nihlathak's story does sound }reasonable, considering what I've }heard about Anya. However, the best }lies are often hidden within truth.}
A5Q3EarlyReturnLarzuk	56}As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is }the only person, besides Nihlathak, }who has any real knowledge of Mount }Arreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our }fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.}
A5Q3EarlyReturnNihlathak	46}Look, I've told you! She's dead! If you }knew what was good for you, you'd }concentrate your efforts on saving }Harrogath -- not on lost causes like }Anya.}
A5Q3EarlyReturnQualKehk	81}It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak }played a part in Anya's disappearance.} }Why would he do such a thing?}
A5Q3FoundAnyaMalah	56}So! That snake Nihlathak was behind }Anya's disappearance...and he trapped }her with a freezing curse.} }Here. Take this potion to Anya and give }it to her. That should release her.}
A5Q3FoundAnyaCain	54}Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen }Barbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah }can help you where I cannot.}
A5Q3FoundAnyaLarzuk	80}Poor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak }was a traitor...} }If you find him alive, kill him for me!}
A5Q3FoundAnyaQualKehk	70}The snake has slipped our grasp! While }you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.} }I'll bet Anya knows how to track him }down.}
A5Q3FoundAnyaAnya	50}Hero. Nihlathak did this to me!} }If you've come to help me, my only hope }lies with Malah.} }Please...Tell her you've found me...}
A5Q3SuccessfulMalah	48}Thank you so much for bringing Anya }back to us. I have devised this spell to }increase your resistances as a token of }my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I }hope you find it helpful.} }Please go talk to Anya. She has urgent }news concerning Nihlathak.}
A5Q3SuccessfulCain	62}For one so young, Anya commands }great respect. Now that she is here, I }will make it a point to talk to her about }Mount Arreat.} }You should do the same.}
A5Q3SuccessfulLarzuk	67}I never liked Nihlathak, but I never }suspected that he'd betray us! I just }can't understand how an Elder could do }such a thing.}
A5Q3SuccessfulQualKehk	140}Your rescue of Anya was quite an }accomplishment.}
A5Q3SuccessfulAnya	80}Thank you, hero, for rescuing me.} }To show my personal gratitude, I give }you this. I had it custom-made for you }by Larzuk.}
A5Q4InitAnya	43}Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with }Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange }for the demon's mercy, the misguided }fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the }Ancients, our most holy totem!} }Doing so will allow Baal to enter Mount }Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I }tried to stop Nihlathak, but he }imprisoned me in that icy tomb.} }Nihlathak must be stopped before he }dooms the whole world. As much as I }would love to strangle the life out of }him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.} }You must go to his lair through this }portal I've opened, kill him, and then }bring back the Relic of the Ancients.} }Stop Nihlathak from destroying what we }have striven for eons to protect.}
A5Q4AfterInitAnya	90}As noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, }nothing can excuse his actions.}
A5Q4AfterInitCain	50}Regretfully, I know very little about this }Relic. However, if what the others say }is true, then Baal must not gain }possession of it.} }Stop Nihlathak...before all is lost.}
A5Q4AfterInitMalah	65}My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak }has gone mad.} }You must stop him, before he gives the }Relic to the Lord of Destruction!}
A5Q4AfterInitLarzuk	56}Now, rescuing Anya -- that's good. }Talking to me while Nihlathak hands }over the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad!}
A5Q4AfterInitQualKehk	60}I saw Nihlathak leave town just before }you found Anya. He must be held }accountable for his criminal deeds.} }Find him and bring him back, if you can. }Likely, he won't come willingly, and }you'll be forced to kill him.} }So be it.}
A5Q4EarlyReturnAnya	55}Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the }Relic, he shall enter the mountain and }wreak havoc there!} }I cannot believe that Nihlathak would }give the Relic to Baal in any kind of }trade. He's truly insane if he believes }that he can deal with the Lord of }Destruction.}
A5Q4EarlyReturnCain	58}Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of }events.} }I know it seems you have always been }one step behind, my friend. But look at }it this way...You have evil on the run.}
A5Q4EarlyReturnLarzuk	160}...What's there to talk about?} }Kill Nihlathak!}
A5Q4EarlyReturnMalah	63}Nihlathak was never the kindest man. }But for him to betray the whole world...} }Ahh...Where shall his soul finally rest?}
A5Q4EarlyReturnQualKehk	65}My advice is to go in quick and hit hard. }Nihlathak can't be half as tough as the }beasts you've faced out there.}
A5Q4SuccessfulAnya	55}You have stopped Nihlathak, but he }didn't have the Relic! He must have }already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will }not be tested when he reaches Arreat's }summit.} }...Damn Nihlathak!} }I do thank you for trying, though. }Please, allow me to honor your courage }by magically inscribing your name onto }an item of your choosing. It's the least }I can do.}
A5Q4SuccessfulCain	90}Beware! Baal grows stronger with every }passing moment.}
A5Q4SuccessfulLarzuk	93}Hmmm...What does Baal plan to do }inside Mount Arreat?}
A5Q4SuccessfulMalah	65}So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on }failures past. It is your future that }matters more.}
A5Q4SuccessfulQualKehk	57}Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall }find his home among the tortured }minions of Hell!} }You battled the Darkness without fear. I }laud your skill and courage.}
A5Q5InitQualKehk	37}Every time I hear of you, warrior, your }deeds become more legendary.} }But take heed. You are approaching the }very summit of Mount Arreat. I have }never dared venture there. It is sacred }-- our most holy place. The legends say }it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who }block the path of all who are unworthy.} }Your reputation here does not }matter...It will be the Ancients who }determine your worthiness.} }Good luck.}
A5Q5AfterInitQualKehk	63}The Ancients are not our enemies. }Remember that! They are our }ancestors -- our gods.}
A5Q5AfterInitCain	90}A test of mettle is a fitting rite of }passage for a Barbarian hero.}
A5Q5AfterInitAnya	72}You wouldn't have to test yourself }against the Ancients if it weren't for }Nihlathak's treachery. He was a fool }and deserves to suffer for eternity.}
A5Q5AfterInitLarzuk	75}Every night, I've prayed to the Ancients }to bring us peace...and now you must }fight them.} }Huh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior?}
A5Q5AfterInitMalah	65}By reaching the summit, you cease }being just a simple warrior. When you }come back, you will be far more.}
A5Q5EarlyReturnQualKehk	114}I warned you!} }The Ancients are not like the demons }you're accustomed to fighting.}
A5Q5EarlyReturnCain	52}We have come too far to be defeated }now, my friend. I have seen you }complete many difficult quests. Though }this may be your greatest trial, it is not }beyond your reach.}
A5Q5EarlyReturnAnya	71}Look. I must apologize.} }I feel responsible for your current }struggle. If I had only stopped }Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, }you would not have to fight those }ghosts.}
A5Q5EarlyReturnLarzuk	70}You've walked on the burial grounds of }our greatest ancestors. I'm not sure }whether I should bow before you or }revile you for committing sacrilege.} }Tread lightly when you walk with gods.}
A5Q5EarlyReturnMalah	68}Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are }worthy to pass through the Ancients' }gates, but you must believe, as well.}
A5Q5SuccessfulQualKehk	75}Besting the Ancients in battle is a }mighty feat indeed. I hope this means }you're ready to battle Baal.}
A5Q5SuccessfulCain	67}You have proven yourself to these }people. They look to you as their }warrior, their champion.}
A5Q5SuccessfulAnya	82}You stand before me a worthy hero -- }and on you rests the last hope of our }people.} }Bear it well, warrior.}
A5Q5SuccessfulLarzuk	82}The Ancients have honored you, and in }turn, so do we. I have no remaining }doubts about you, now.}
A5Q5SuccessfulMalah	60}I knew the Ancients would find you }worthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, }stop Baal before he destroys all that is }sacred.}
A5Q6InitAncients	31}You are a worthy hero! We augment }your skill and grant you entry to the }interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies }the Worldstone.} }Beware. You will not be alone. Baal the }Lord of Destruction is already inside. } }The Archangel Tyrael has always been }our benefactor, but even he cannot }help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's }spiritual presence from entering the }chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, }mortal, have the power to defeat Baal }now.} }Baal threatens the Worldstone -- and }through it, the mortal realm, itself. You }must stop him before he gains full }control of the sacred stone. With it }under his control, Baal could shatter }the boundaries between this world and }the Burning Hells, thus allowing the }hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth }into the mortal realm like an }unstoppable tide!} }If you are weak, the world as you know }it could be lost forever. You must NOT }fail!}
A5Q6EarlyReturnCain	51}Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal }Rasha, one of the most powerful of the }ancient Horadrim.} }Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo }will pale in comparison to your battle }with Baal.} }The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal }Rasha's knowledge...The mountain }itself will tremble when you clash.}
A5Q6EarlyReturnLarzuk	59}I may be just an armorer, but I know }this...Baal plans to destroy the world }with the secrets contained in that }mountain. It doesn't take a genius to }know he has to be stopped.}
A5Q6EarlyReturnMalah	70}You knew it would eventually come down }to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!}
A5Q6EarlyReturnAnya	60}Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering }the Worldstone Chamber? This truly }has become a battle against Hell.} }Whether or not it was the Heavens' }decree, this is your fight now -- your }destiny.}
A5Q6EarlyReturnQualKehk	63}You have ventured to a place beyond }legend. You rush to face an evil few }can even imagine.} }Be careful, my friend, and may the Light }watch over you.}
A5Q6SuccessfulTyrael	40}I am impressed, mortal. You have }overcome the greatest challenge this }world has ever faced and defeated the }last of the Prime Evils. However, we are }too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's }destructive touch has corrupted it }completely.} }Given enough time, the Worldstone's }energies will drain away and the }barriers between the worlds will }shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood }into this...Sanctuary...and eradicate }your people and everything you've }labored to build.} }Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted }Worldstone before the powers of Hell }take root. This act will change your }world forever -- with consequences }even I cannot foresee. However, it is }the only way to ensure mankind's }survival.} }Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal }that will lead you to safety.} }May the Eternal Light shine upon you }and your descendants for what you've }done this day. The continued survival }of mankind is your legacy! Above all }else, you have earned a rest from this }endless battle.}
A5Q6SuccessfulAnya	53}You have done the impossible, hero. }Your defeat of the last of the three }Prime Evils is a great victory for the }Light. } }Strange that you say that the }Worldstone must be destroyed. The }prophecies said nothing about that.} }Perhaps all we have fought for will be }lost...or perhaps we'll never need fight }again!}
A5Q6SuccessfulCain	40}I knew in time you would defeat Baal. }You have done everything you set out }to do, my friend.} }Ever since you rescued me from }Tristram, I have believed in you. It has }been a supreme honor to aid you along }the way. } }So...The Worldstone was corrupted by }Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. }Worry not. Through whatever lies }ahead I have faith that the Light will }guide us both.} }Go, now, back to the Worldstone }chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael }has opened for you.}
A5Q6SuccessfulLarzuk	74}The Ancients themselves will envy our }songs about you.} }Please, don't forget about us! Farewell, }my friend.}
A5Q6SuccessfulMalah	48}If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be }destroyed, then it must. We cannot let }Baal's corruption prevail!} }The world will change, true -- but who is }to say it isn't for the better?}
A5Q6SuccessfulQualKehk	60}The destruction of the Worldstone does }not bode well for our world. But I'll try }not to worry...} }After all, we have warriors like you }fighting for us and for the Light.} }Farewell!}
