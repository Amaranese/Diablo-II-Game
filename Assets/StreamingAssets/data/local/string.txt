WarrivAct1IntroGossip1	45}Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised }to see your kind here. Many }adventurers have traveled this way }since the recent troubles began.} }No doubt you've heard about the }tragedy that befell the town of }Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the }Lord of Terror, walks the world again.} }I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark }Wanderer did travel this route a few }weeks ago. He was headed east to the }mountain pass guarded by the Rogue }Monastery.} }Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to }have trailed in his wake. You see, }shortly after the Wanderer went }through, the Monastery's Gates to the }pass were closed and strange }creatures began ravaging the }countryside.} }Until it's safer outside the camp and the }gates are re-opened, I'll remain here }with my caravan. I hope to leave for }Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell }over Tristram consumes us all.  If }you're still alive then, I'll take you }along.} }You should talk to Akara, too. She }seems to be the leader of this camp. }Maybe she can tell you more.}
WarrivAct1IntroPalGossip1	45}Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a }while since I've seen any of your kind in }the west. It would be an honor to aid }you in any way that I can.} }No doubt you've heard about the }tragedy that befell the town of }Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the }Lord of Terror, walks the world again.} }I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark }Wanderer did travel this route a few }weeks ago.

She }seems to be the leader of this camp. }Maybe she can tell you more.}
WarrivGossip1	51}I've been leading my trade caravan }across the eastern deserts for more }than twenty years now. I've been }attacked by bandits and outlaws more }times than I can remember. But never }when a Paladin accompanied me. } }Indeed, your Order has saved me from }losing a small fortune over the years. I }just hope you can discover what's }going on around here and get the }Gates to the East opened up!}
WarrivGossip2	85}Cain seems to have great wisdom }regarding the supernatural. I hope I }never live to be that wise...}
WarrivGossip3	58}Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She }sells the few magic items in her }possession and can even heal your }wounds. She is very wise and will help }you if she can.}
WarrivGossip4	66}The fiery Kashya commands the Rogue }archers in battle. I've only spoken to }her a few times, though. I get the }feeling that she doesn't like outsiders }very much.}
WarrivGossip5	88}Charsi seems to be a very sweet girl. }She's the smith around here and can }help you by trading weapons and }armor.}
WarrivGossip6	55}Gheed is a wandering merchant of }questionable character who is traveling }along with my caravan to the East. He }will buy and sell most anything.} }He's greedy, but his wares are beyond }reproach. I would suggest keeping both }eyes open when you deal with him.}
WarrivGossip7	71}To the east are lands of great }mystery... and the Jewel City of the }Desert, Lut Gholein.}
WarrivGossip8	68}I'll gladly take you eastward, if you can }drive the Evil from the Monastery.  }Then, the Rogues may re-open the pass }through the mountains.}
WarrivGossip9	70}It's easy to become lost in the }wilderness on the way to the Citadel. }After you have come to the Cairn }Stones, you must remember that the }path continues through the caves.}
AkaraIntroGossip1	35}I am Akara, High Priestess of the }Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I }welcome you, traveler, to our camp, }but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor }shelter within these rickety walls.} }You see, our ancient Sisterhood has }fallen under a strange curse. The }mighty Citadel from which we have }guarded the gates to the East for }generations, has been corrupted by the }evil Demoness, Andariel.} }I still can't believe it... but she turned }many of our sister Rogues against us }and drove us from our ancestral home. }Now the last defenders of the }Sisterhood are either dead or scattered }throughout the wilderness.} }I implore you, stranger. Please help us. }Find a way to lift this terrible curse and }we will pledge our loyalty to you for all }time.}
AkaraIntroSorGossip1	34}Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good }to see more of your kind at work in the }world these dark days. In my opinion, }the world needs more women to fight }against the great shadow. But I am }forgetting my manners... } }I am Akara, High Priestess of the }Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I }welcome you, traveler, to our camp, }but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor }shelter within these rickety walls.} }You see, our ancient Sisterhood has }fallen under a strange curse. The }mighty Citadel from which we have }guarded the gates to the East for }generations, has been corrupted by the }evil Demoness, Andariel.} }I still can't believe it... but she turned }many of our sister Rogues against us }and drove us from our ancestral home. }Now the last defenders of the }Sisterhood are either dead or scattered }throughout the wilderness.} }I implore you, stranger: please help us. }Find a way to lift this terrible curse and }we will pledge our loyalty to you for all }time.}
AkaraGossip1	42}The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has }a long and distinguished history. Over }the generations our Order has become }a deadly fighting force as well as a }bastion for women who sought to forge }their own destiny.} }Yet beware, young one, the lure of }power and knowledge can lead to }disaster. I have seen ambition foul the }bravest of hearts and recklessness dull }hard-won wisdom.} }You would do well to tread lightly upon }the dark path you have chosen to }explore.}
AkaraGossip2	49}I understand that Cain is the last }descendant of the ancient Horadrim }and that his knowledge of their lore is }vast. He could prove to be very useful }in discerning the nature of our current }crisis.}
AkaraGossip3	49}Kashya has always been fiercely loyal, }but I fear her anger and frustration }over these recent events will lead her }into harm's way. She is highly }protective of the few Rogues remaining }under her command and will not send }them into combat unless there is dire }need.}
AkaraGossip4	46}Charsi is young and innocent. However, }I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to }the prospect of adventure and danger. }She takes great pride in her work and }finds comfort in the fact that her }weapons and armor are helping to end }this evil plague.}
AkaraGossip5	48}Though he has only been our guest for }a short time, I sense that Warriv has }faced many harrowing trials. Though }he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil }has blanketed the land, his only real }concern is to reach the eastern trading }ports with his caravan.}
AkaraGossip6	53}To be honest, I have done my best to }stay clear of Gheed. He wears }dishonesty about himself like a cloak }and seeks only to better his situation }by preying on the misfortunes of }others.}
AkaraGossip7	55}The wilderness is overrun with Evil and }the minions of Hell have taken our }rightful home. We must purge all Evil }from the Monastery and restore order }to the world.}
AkaraGossip8	53}I often dream of the day we reclaim our }own. The Sightless Eye sees through }the mist of time a great glory ahead, }but how far ahead the Eye cannot }discern.}
AkaraGossip9	67}Our mental discipline is matched only by }our skill in archery... I only hope these }are enough to withstand this awful }trial.}
AkaraGossip10	59}Beware that you do not suffer the fate }of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's }life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul }is even worse.}
AkaraGossip11	41}Even though the corrupted ones were }once of our Order, you need not shy }from slaying them, for they stand }between you and Andariel.} }Perhaps, when the Demon Queen is }dead, our Sisters will return to life, but }more likely they will be forever bound }to their unholy pact.}
KashyaIntroGossip1	56}Welcome, outlander, to our glorious }hovel. I know you're here to challenge }the evil that's driven us from our }ancestral home.} }But, know this. Akara may be our }spiritual leader, but I command the }Rogues in battle. It will take more than }just killing a few beasts in the }wilderness to earn my trust.}
KashyaIntroAmaGossip1	55}Well, well, I never expected to see an }Amazon in these lands. You're very }brave to have come here. Many of my }fellow Sisters have fallen under some }dark spell, and if you're not careful you }may fall prey to it as well.}
KashyaGossip1	60}When I was very young, Akara told me }tales of the Amazons' fearlessness in }battle and of their skills with spears }and bows. I like to think we Rogues }have much in common with you }Amazons.}
KashyaGossip2	64}Some of my Rogues told me of Deckard }Cain. They said that he is a man of }great wisdom. Personally, I don't know }how wise he could possibly be if he }never learned how to wage battle }himself.}
KashyaGossip3	57}Akara has been like a mother to me for }as long as I can remember. She is wise }and good, but I don't think she has the }steel to retake our Monastery by force.}
KashyaGossip4	89}I don't trust many outlanders, but }Warriv seems fine. He never says much }to me, though.}
KashyaGossip5	66}Before our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith, }could fashion any implement of war.} }Here in the camp, she merely makes do. }Her best tools remain within the }Monastery.}
KashyaGossip6	58}Gheed is a pig. I've been tempted to }throw him out of the camp many times, }but Charsi seems to think that he's }good company. I don't trust the man, }but if she's comforted by him, then I'll }desist.}
KashyaGossip7	76}If we could only find out how Andariel }has managed to corrupt our Sisters, }then, perhaps, we could drive out the }evil clouding their minds.}
KashyaGossip8	68}In this camp, those of us who have }remained true to our Order are forced }to live among common traders and }farm animals.} }Welcome to our circle of suffering.}
KashyaGossip9	67}Perhaps Tristram deserved its fate... }for letting Evil loose upon the land. I }only hope we don't suffer the same.}
KashyaGossip10	71}Some evenings we gather at the bonfire }to retell epic tales... and try to forget }about the terrible events that led to }losing the Monastery.}
CharsiIntroGossip1	47}Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here }in camp. It's good to see some strong }adventurers around here.} }Many of our Sisters fought bravely }against Diablo when he first attacked }the town of Tristram. They came back }to us true veterans, bearing some }really powerful items. Seems like their }victory was short-lived, though... Most }of them are now corrupted by Andariel.}
CharsiIntroBarGossip1	54}Wow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's }really great to meet you. I've seen a }few of your kind around here lately. I'm }a little jealous... I wish I could go off }adventuring with you.} }Oh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the }blacksmith here in camp.}
CharsiGossip1	57}You know, I've been with the Sisters for }as long as I can remember. But Akara }told me that my real parents were }Barbarians from the northern tribes }and that they were killed when I was }very young.} }Sometimes I wonder what my life would }have been like if I had been raised as a }Barbarian.} }I don't know. I love being a blacksmith... }but sometimes I just want to get out }and explore the world, you know?}
CharsiGossip2	86}I don't really know anything about Cain. }He seems to have a lot of secrets... }That makes me nervous.}
CharsiGossip3	51}Oh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a }little hard on outsiders, but who can }blame her? All she wants is to protect }our Order. But now that our Sisters }have turned against us... I think this }whole mess has hardened her heart.}
CharsiGossip4	64}Akara, our priestess and seer, is most }upset by the corruption of our Sisters. }I fear that she blames herself.}
CharsiGossip5	80}Warriv's all right, I guess. He seems too }serious most of the time. I haven't }really talked to him all that much.}
CharsiGossip6	60}Oh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He }has all sorts of interesting stories from }the places he's been. I wish I could see }the sights he has.}
CharsiGossip7	84}I don't know why some of my Sisters }chose to follow Andariel. Those who }strayed were among our finest }warriors.}
GheedIntroGossip1	48}Good day to you partner! I'm Gheed and }I can already tell that I'll be your best }friend in this forsaken camp.} }A spare weapon, some gold, a small }gem is all I want in exchange for the }equipment you'll need on whatever }quests you might undertake.} }Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my }items are guaranteed for life and come }with a two-day warranty!}
GheedIntroNecGossip1	46}A Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have }to lay my eyes on one of your kind }again. ... The recent troubles in this }area have brought out all kinds, I see. }Nevertheless, your money's good...} }A spare weapon, some gold, a small }gem is all I want in exchange for the }equipment you'll need on whatever }quests you might undertake!} }Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my }items are guaranteed for life and come }with a two-day warranty!}
GheedGossip1	74}Don't think you can fool me, }Necromancer. I've seen what your kind }can do. If you're involved in any of the }evil out there, I don't even want to }know. Trade quickly and be about your }business!}
GheedGossip2	57}That old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet }Quill Rat. I hear he survived whatever }happened in Tristram. Personally, I }wouldn't trust a thing he has to say.}
GheedGossip3	55}Akara and Kashya are Sisters in the }Order of the Sightless Eye, but they are }worlds apart. Akara is a slow river of }magic, and Kashya, a viper of war. }They're both deeply devoted to their }religious order, yet the corruption of }their Sisters pains them both to no }end.}
GheedGossip4	52}Charsi is a fine girl..., but she has no }business savvy! I know she means well, }but the prices she charges for weapons }and armor will never earn her a profit.} }As long as I keep filling her mind with }stories of adventure, she'll never catch }on to the fact that I'm raking in gold }hand over fist!}
GheedGossip5	55}Warriv was kind enough to let me travel }with his caravan, but don't let him drag }you into a search for a new Eastern }trade route.} }I'm making a fortune right here... from }the Rogues, of course! You, on the }other hand, always get my best prices!}
GheedGossip6	61}Andariel's demonic forces have taken up }residence in the forests as well as the }Monastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing }out of the camp. So, if you need }anything, I'll be right here.}
GheedGossip7	58}When - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm }going to find the largest bowl of }Narlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly }sense has left my body.}
CainGossip1	43}Long ago, the Soulstones were given to }the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. }They were used to bind the three Prime }Evils. I now know that even these holy }artifacts were no match for Diablo's }power.} }I hope that his two brothers are more }securely held... but I fear the worst.}
CainGossip2	54}It takes time to master your skills... and }use will hone your technique. But take }care to choose your new skills wisely.}
CainGossip3	52}You may recover some mysterious }things from the demons you kill. Some }of great use to you... some of great }peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal }their secrets.}
CainGossip4	46}Have I told you about the Horadrim? }They were an ancient confederation of }mage-clans who sought to bind the }three Prime Evils for eternity. The }Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... }and it appears that the bonds they }wove are unravelling!} }As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that }I can help you remedy their failure.}
CainGossip5	43}Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were }cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It }seems that Hell's balance has shifted, }as Andariel is now aligned with the }Lord of Terror. Her presence here in }the mortal realm does not bode well for }us.}
RogueSignpostGossip1	90}Turn back! I can tell that you need more }experience to fight safely in the next }wilderness.}
RogueSignpostGossip2	46}Halt! You should complete Akara's quest }before venturing further. Search for }the Den in the wilderness closer to }camp.}
RogueSignpostGossip3	116}Beware! The evil is strong ahead.}
RogueSignpostGossip4	92}Beware! Beyond lies mortal danger for }the likes of you!}
RogueSignpostGossip5	88}Take care! The Corrupted Rogues in the }wilderness ahead are not to be trifled }with.}
A1Q1InitAkara	43}There is a place of great evil in the }wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts }have informed me that a cave nearby is }filled with shadowy creatures and }horrors from beyond the grave.} }I fear that these creatures are massing }for an attack against our encampment. }If you are sincere about helping us, }find the dark labyrinth and destroy the }foul beasts.} }May the Great Eye watch over you.}
A1Q1AfterInitAkara	46}I should add that many Rogue scouts }have died in that horrible place. We }cannot afford to lose any more. If you }choose to enter that Den of Evil, you }must do so alone.}
A1Q1AfterInitKashya	87}The demons in that cave have claimed }many of my finest archers. I wonder }how you will fare!}
A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain	95}The beasts from the cave have begun to }roam throughout the countryside. }You'd better be careful out there.}
A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt	95}You seem like a noble warrior. I hope }you can help us.}
A1Q1AfterInitGheed	67}You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust }my sacred scepter into the foulest, }carbuncular trull than set one boot }into that cave.}
A1Q1AfterInitWarriv	122}One who seeks that cave, seeks death.}
A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara	85}Your task is not complete until you have }killed all the demons in that cave.}
A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya	111}You'd better come through on this. Your }reputation depends on it.}
A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi	148}You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do }you need anything?}
A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed	73}Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I }think you might need a new weapon.}
A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv	124}One who hesitates... does so with good }reason.}
A1Q1SuccessfulAkara	65}You have cleansed the Den of Evil. }You've earned my trust and may yet }restore my faith in humanity.} }Your reward is training in the skill of }your choice.}
A1Q1SuccessfulKashya	74}Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that }test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may }reward you.}
A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi	94}You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara }was worried about you.}
A1Q1SuccessfulGheed	87}The only good demon is a dead one, I }say.} }By the way, did you happen to find }anything in that cave you'd like to sell?}
A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv	120}...That which does not kill you makes }you stronger.}
A1Q2InitKashya	56}My Rogue scouts have just reported an }abomination in the Monastery }graveyard!} }Apparently, Andariel is not content to }take only our living. Blood Raven, one }of our finest captains in the battle }against Diablo at Tristram, was also }one of the first to be corrupted by }Andariel.} }Now, you'll find her in the Monastery }graveyard raising our dead as }zombies!} }We cannot abide this defilement! If you }are truly our ally, you will help us }destroy her.}
A1Q2AfterInitKashya	80}Death has done nothing to weaken }Blood Raven's combat skills. If }anything, she's more deadly than ever.}
A1Q2AfterInitCharsi	99}Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue }band that once fought Diablo at }Tristram.}
A1Q2AfterInitGheed	94}I'm sorry... The undead are bad for }trade. I have a strict no-return policy.}
A1Q2AfterInitAkara	51}Blood Raven fought valiantly against }Diablo in the catacombs beneath }Tristram... She was never quite the }same afterwards. It is now obvious she }brought an evil influence back with her.}
A1Q2AfterInitWarriv	140}Hmmm...} }How can one kill what is already dead?}
A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya	99}Each moment you delay adds another }undead Sister to Blood Raven's army.}
A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara	70}If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear }that our Order will perish forever.}
A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi	68}Akara felt something was wrong even }before Andariel descended upon us. }She feared that Blood Raven had }stumbled upon some evil force beneath }Tristram.} }I wish we had acted then...}
A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed	77}I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is }among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on }everybody.}
A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv	86}When the dead return to prey upon the }living, it is a terror beyond }understanding.}
A1Q2SuccessfulKashya	55}I can hardly believe that you've defeated }Blood Raven!} }Though she was once my closest friend, }I pray that her tortured spirit remains }banished forever.} }You have earned my respect, stranger... }and the allegiance of the Rogues. I }have placed several of my best }warriors at your disposal.}
A1Q2SuccessfulAkara	122}Andariel must be made to pay for her }sacrilege!}
A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi	77}Kashya wishes to reward you for your }defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, }too, even though Blood Raven was once }my friend.}
A1Q2SuccessfulGheed	148}Some of those gals weren't so nice the }first time around.}
A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv	104}You've done well, stranger. I hope all }your efforts are worth it.}
A1Q4InitAkara	50}It is clear that we are facing an Evil }difficult to comprehend, let alone }combat.} }There is only one Horadrim sage, }schooled in the most arcane history }and lore, who could advise us... His }name is Deckard Cain.} }You must go to Tristram and find him, }my friend. I pray that he still lives.}
A1Q4AfterInitScrollKashya	90}The bark of Inifuss holds mystical }runes.} }Akara can translate them... into our }revenge!}
A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara	42}Tristram is too far to journey by foot...  }Cain would likely be dead, when you }arrived. However, there is a magical }portal that will take you there }instantly.} }To open it, one must stand within the }circle of Cairn Stones and touch them }in a certain order. The proper order }can be found in the runes written on }the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.} }You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss }and bring back its bark. I will translate }the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic }pattern.}
A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi	117}If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, }Akara will tell you how to get to }Tristram.}
A1Q4AfterInitScrollWarriv	68}Months ago, I came across a few }survivors from Tristram. They said }that Cain had gone half-mad and could }no longer distinguish fact from }fantasy.}
A1Q4AfterInitScrollGheed	98}I would sooner micturate in a tankard }of my own ale than journey to }Tristram!}
A1Q4InstructionsCharsi	150}Without the bark of Inifuss you can't }find Cain.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnSAkara	76}How will you find Cain without going to }Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is }the first step on your journey.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnSKashya	96}The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but }you'll know it when you see it.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnSGheed	99}Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll }find it, just keep looking.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnSWarriv	70}He who seeks that which cannot be }found must look inside himself for }further guidance... or look harder!}
A1Q4SuccessfulScrollKashya	82}With this scroll you may open a portal }back to Tristram. Only Akara can }decipher its logic.}
A1Q4SuccessfulScrollCharsi	168}Get this to Akara.} }Only she can understand it.}
A1Q4SuccessfulScrollGheed	72}Look, friend... I trade a lot of strange }items, but I'm not going to start }dealing in bark. Okay?}
A1Q4SuccessfulScrollWarriv	86}This looks like gibberish to me. Akara }may know what to make of it.}
A1Q4InstructionsAkara	64}Ah, very good. I have translated the }runes on this scroll. You must find the }Cairn Stones and touch them in the }order that I have written.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnKashya	103}Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge }about the Evils we face. You must find }him!}
A1Q4EarlyReturnCharsi	92}I have heard that Tristram is now in }ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin }of all of us.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnGheed	68}I'm told that Tristram now resembles a }mead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! }I will wait here for your most glorious }return.}
A1Q4EarlyReturnWarriv	82}It is too dangerous to travel to }Tristram. I won't be leaving here until }the way is clear!}
A1Q4EarlyReturnAkara	64}If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in }grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram }before all is lost!}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulAkara	82}You have risked your life to rescue }Cain. For that we thank you.} }We must seek his counsel immediately.}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulKashya	78}Again, you amaze me, outlander.} }The Sisterhood is grateful to you for }delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara }has something to tell you.}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulGheed	53}Ah, Cain is here... another customer. I }haven't been this pleased since a }love-starved maiden let down a bit }more than her hair.}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCharsi	102}Akara wishes to reward you for your }bravery in returning Deckard Cain.}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulWarriv	80}Only a brave adventurer could return }with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward }for your valor.}
A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCain	74}As a token of my gratitude, I will }identify items for you at no charge.}
A1Q4RescuedByHeroCain	82}...I thank you, friend, for coming to my }aid.}
A1Q4RescuedByRoguesCain	75}Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They }finally rescued me from that cursed }place!}
A1Q4TragedyOfTristramCain	33}Regrettably, I could do nothing to }prevent the disaster which devastated }Tristram. It would appear that our }greatest fears have come to pass. }Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once }again been set loose upon the world!} }As you know, some time ago Diablo was }slain beneath Tristram.  And when our }hero emerged triumphant from the }labyrinth beneath town, we held a }grand celebration that lasted several }days.} }Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero }became increasingly aloof. He kept his }distance from the rest of the townsfolk }and seemed to lapse into a dark, }brooding depression. I thought that }perhaps his ordeal had been so }disturbing that he simply could not put }it out of his mind.} }The hero seemed more tormented every }passing day. I remember he awoke }many times -- screaming in the night -- }always something about 'the East'.} }One day, he simply left. And shortly }thereafter Tristram was attacked by }legions of foul demons. Many were }slain, and the demons left me to die in }that cursed cage.} }I believe now that Tristram's hero was }that Dark Wanderer who passed this }way before the Monastery fell.} }I fear even worse, my friend... I fear }that Diablo has taken possession of the }hero who sought to slay him. If true, }Diablo will become more powerful than }ever before.} }You must stop him or all will be lost.}
A1Q5InitQuestTome	36}...And so it came to pass that the }Countess, who once bathed in the }rejuvenating blood of a hundred }virgins, was buried alive... And her }castle in which so many cruel deeds }took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising }over the buried dungeons in that }god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary }tower, like some monument to Evil, is }all that remains.} }The Countess' fortune was believed to }be divided among the clergy, although }some say that more remains unfound, }still buried alongside the rotting skulls }that bear mute witness to the }inhumanity of the human creature.}
A1Q5AfterInitGheed	110}The only wealth you're likely to find }there is a wealth of vermin.}
A1Q5AfterInitCharsi	70}That old tower is as rotten on the inside }as it appears on the outside. I heard }that several Sisters came to a }gruesome end when a stairwell }collapsed on them.}
A1Q5AfterInitAkara	67}The dangers there are not solely }architectural. Once inside that }wretched place, many succumb to a }vile miasma.}
A1Q5AfterInitCain	60}That tower marks a place of danger. }There is an epic poem about it...  How }much sorrow one can stand was tested }there.}
A1Q5AfterInitWarriv	81}Rumors of treasure are no different }from rumors of any other kind. They }hold false promise to those who should }know better.}
A1Q5AfterInitKashya	78}The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we }have found are death, delirium, and }disappointment.}
A1Q5EarlyReturnKashya	151}Have you suddenly lost your taste for }wealth?}
A1Q5EarlyReturnCain	94}Quickly in and quickly out is all the }advice I can give you.}
A1Q5EarlyReturnWarriv	118}Better an empty pocket than a full }grave.}
A1Q5EarlyReturnCharsi	170}You're not ready to give up, are you?}
A1Q5EarlyReturnAkara	140}There is no more I can tell you about }that ancient tower.}
A1Q5EarlyReturnGheed	79}Guess what! I've named a boil on my }ass after you. It, too, bothers me every }time I sit down.}
A1Q5SuccessfulKashya	79}Your rewards are well-earned. To us, }the tower was nothing more than a }headstone looming over a long }forgotten grave.}
A1Q5SuccessfulWarriv	62}Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial }as a cloud and passes as quickly. }Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not }bold.}
A1Q5SuccessfulGheed	68}Warriv's advice is like corpse gas; it }befouls the air for a moment and then }it disappears.}
A1Q5SuccessfulAkara	58}I thought the stories of treasure in the }tower were nothing but lies. I am glad }you found something of value in that }death-trap. Would that our Sisters had }been so fortunate.}
A1Q5SuccessfulCharsi	126}Those riches will serve you well on the }long road ahead.}
A1Q5SuccessfulCain	69}Well done, my friend. Courage and }opportunity together have created in }you a kind of alchemy.}
A1Q3InitCharsi	66}When I fled the Monastery, I left behind }the Horadric Malus, my enchanted }smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it }for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen }your equipment.}
A1Q3AfterInitCain	51}The Malus was forged and enchanted by }the ancient Horadric Mages during the }Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, }the Malus was entrusted to the }Sisterhood guarding the pass into the }East.}
A1Q3AfterInitAkara	59}The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is }not without risk. Our Monastery is }filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd }best be careful, my friend.}
A1Q3AfterInitKashya	61}Charsi is wasting her time and talents }using an inferior hammer! Had she the }Horadric Malus, she could make the }steel sing and craft you a suit of armor }as impenetrable as the Great Eye.}
A1Q3AfterInitCharsi	87}The Monastery can confuse even those }who know it well. Stay alert in there.}
A1Q3AfterInitGheed	74}Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but }this Horadric Malus. Between you and }her my ears need a rest.} }Just find it and bring it back quickly.}
A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt	74}I have offered my nomadic phallus, but }to no avail.}
A1Q3AfterInitWarriv	68}Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, }or a draughtsman pen and paper, so }Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with }which to ply her trade.}
A1Q3EarlyReturnCain	57}The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, }search thoroughly in the Barracks... }That is where the Rogues kept their }forge.}
A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara	98}If you can't carry out this quest, how }will you face the greater evils ahead?}
A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya	71}To do battle with Andariel requires }more than thick skin and a strong will. }You'll want armor and weaponry forged }with the hammer's enchantments.}
A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi	89}The Malus is a Horadric artifact of }great power. Please bring it back.}
A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed	90}I have heard that you bear us no Malus.}
A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv	120}What better opportunity to show your }mettle?}
A1Q3SuccessfulCain	59}The magical effects imbued by the }Malus are impossible to predict, but }are always to the good.}
A1Q3SuccessfulAkara	57}Well done, my friend. But remember, the }return of the Horadric Malus is but one }step in reclaiming the Monastery.}
A1Q3SuccessfulKashya	74}Now that the Horadric Malus is back in }our possession, we shall use it to }deliver a great blow against the Evil }which torments this land.}
A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi	72}Oh! Thanks so much for returning the }Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of }your items with magical powers.}
A1Q3SuccessfulGheed	120}I guess it's too late to take back some }of the names I called you.}
A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv	118}I am glad the hammer has returned and }you with it.}
A1Q6InitCain	34}It is certain that we face the demon }queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the }Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their }ancestral Monastery. This does not }bode well for us, my friend.} }Ancient Horadric texts record that }Andariel and the other Lesser Evils }once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- }Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing }them from Hell to our world. Here, they }caused mankind untold anguish and }suffering before they were finally }bound within the Soulstones.} }Andariel's presence here could mean }that the forces of Hell are once again }aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. }If this is true, then I fear for us all.} }You must kill her before the Monastery }becomes a permanent outpost of Hell }and the way east lost forever.}
A1Q6AfterInitCain	45}Diablo is heading east for some foul }purpose. And the only passage east is }through the Monastery gate. }Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel }to block any pursuit.} }For her part Andariel hopes to win }Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are }always vying for positions of power }within the unholy hierarchy!}
A1Q6AfterInitAkara	63}Andariel has desecrated all we hold }dear. She must not be permitted to }serve Diablo.} }Destroy her! Her corruption of our }Order must be undone!}
A1Q6AfterInitCharsi	132}Send Andariel back to the Hell she came }from!}
A1Q6AfterInitGheed	71}You're going after Andariel?} }... One of my wagon wheels is in need of }repair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm }needed.}
A1Q6AfterInitWarriv	72}The mapmakers tell us the shortest }distance between two points is a }straight line.} }Our way east is a line that runs through }Andariel's stronghold, the Monastery.}
A1Q6AfterInitKashya	81}I can imagine a thousand different ways }to kill Andariel. You need only choose }one.}
A1Q6EarlyReturnCain	48}It is clear that Andariel is acting on }behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone }from following him eastward. Her }defeat would allow you to continue the }pursuit.} }Ancient lore has it that while Andariel }was spawned in the Burning Hells, she }is not fond of fire.}
A1Q6EarlyReturnAkara	57}You have done much to help us, but I }sense that this has only fueled }Andariel's fury. She will not stop until }we are all dead.} }You must kill Andariel before her army }can gain the upper hand.}
A1Q6EarlyReturnGheed	72}Have you stumbled upon that Demon }Queen, yet? I hear she's quite the }beauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish }go, that is.}
A1Q6EarlyReturnCharsi	108}If you are the hero that you seem to be, }now is the time to prove it.}
A1Q6EarlyReturnWarriv	90}May I remind you that my caravan can }only go east, if the Monastery is }cleansed?}
A1Q6EarlyReturn2Kashya	126}Deckard Cain has important information }about Andariel.}
A1Q6SuccessfulAkara	64}Finally, we may rejoice!} }We owe you a debt we can never repay. }I only hope that in time we will be able }to rebuild our Order.} }All our thanks go with you, my friend.}
A1Q6SuccessfulCharsi	86}You'll probably go east now... It was }good to know you. I hope you'll come }back if you ever need anything.}
A1Q6SuccessfulKashya	44}Andariel's death brings about renewed }life for us all. We mourn the loss of our }dear Sisters, but at least now we can }get on with our lives.} }I... may have misjudged you, outlander. }You are a true hero and testament to }the noble spirit which has inspired our }Order for generations.} }Fare well... my friend.}
A1Q6SuccessfulGheed	100}I'm going to party like it's 999!}
A1Q6SuccessfulWarriv	82}The caravan is prepared. We may now }journey eastward to Lut Gholein.}
A1Q6SuccessfulCain	38}This is a great victory indeed, but many }more battles await. I will accompany }you on your journey, lending what }assistance I can... } }Remember... Diablo is still out there, }seeking something in the desert. I'm }afraid that this nightmare will not end }until you find what it is that he seeks.}
PalaceGuardGossip1	600}Halt.}
PalaceGuardGossip2	290}You may not pass.}
PalaceGuardGossip3	255}Welcome to the palace.}
PalaceGuardGossip4	255}You may enter the palace.}
PalaceGuardGossip5	290}Stay out of trouble.}
GriezIntroGossip1	58}I'll bet you wonder how this town }manages to stay safe with all the }trouble going on out in the desert. }Well, I can tell you that it's got nothing }to do with the local town guards... }they're all in the palace for some }reason.} }Jerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to }help keep the peace around here. We're }not cheap, but we're the best this }wasteland has to offer.}
GriezGossip1	85}We do a good job in town, but beyond }the city gates, you'll find all manner of }demons.}
GriezGossip2	52}The local guards were all relocated to }the palace after the troubles began. No }one really knows why. Actually, all of }the town's brothel girls have been }hiding out in the palace's cellar lately, }so I assume that the guards have been }assigned to 'protect them' with their }lives.}
GriezGossip3	75}I might spare you a few of my men. }Why, enough gold can muster an army.}
GriezGossip4	61}Jerhyn's got a nice little trading post }going here. Despite his youth, he is a }clever businessman. As you can see by }that palace, he's done quite well for }himself.}
GriezGossip5	99}We're keeping the town safe and tight, }but I've got a hunch there's something }Jerhyn's not telling us.}
GriezGossip6	44}Ah, Elzix is quite a character. I had a }few run-ins with his band of outlaws in }my younger years. Now, he's as settled }as the dunes out there. The Desert Rain }Inn is his pride and joy these days.}
GriezGossip7	53}Atma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm }sure the loss of her family has made }her lonely. Perhaps I should go over }and console her when I get off duty }tonight...}
GriezGossip8	72}Geglash is an imposing warrior, but he's }never been able to back down from a }fight. One of these days, his pride will }be the death of him.}
GriezGossip9	67}Meshif has sailed all around the }southern seas and visited many }strange lands. It must be driving him }mad, having to stay anchored here.}
GriezGossip10	70}I haven't talked much to Fara. She }keeps to herself most of the time. I get }the feeling that she doesn't like us }mercenary types much.}
GriezGossip11	73}I'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. }He's always mixing his damned potions }and chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised }if he winds up blowing himself to }smithereens!}
GriezGossip12	85}Drognan's a mystery to me. Then again, }I never did trust mages much.}
ElzixIntroGossip1	61}Hmm... You look like a sturdy }adventurer.} }You know, I used to be quite the }scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest }group of bandits who ever terrorized }these sands!} }Nowadays, I run this here Inn and }pretty much stay out of trouble.} }My days of adventuring are behind me.}
ElzixIntroNecGossip1	48}Ah... You must be one of the new }heroes who've come to rid our city of }evil. Under any other circumstances, I'd }be surprised to see one of your kind in }the city. But lately... Oh, never mind all }that...} }You know, I used to be quite the }scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest }group of bandits who ever terrorized }these sands!} }Nowadays, I run this here Inn and }pretty much stay out of trouble.} }My days of adventuring are behind me.}
ElzixGossip1	52}You know, I've lost a number of body }parts over the years. An eye here, a leg }there...} }Say, do you know any spells that'd grow }them back for me? Hmm... On second }thought, I'll leave well enough alone.}
ElzixGossip2	90}What tales Drognan can tell... You }would do well to listen carefully to that }wizened wizard.}
ElzixGossip3	80}There are many ancient tombs in the }desert. Most of them are already }plundered, but I imagine that some }have remained hidden.}
ElzixGossip4	67}I miss the brothels that used to do }business here.} }You know, all of the ladies fled to the }palace as soon as the trouble in the }desert started. You'd think that they }could at least come out once in a while }now that Greiz and his men have things }relatively under control.}
ElzixGossip5	71}Atma... Now, there's a fine woman. }Lately, though, she's only thinking }about revenge. She has reason }enough...}
ElzixGossip6	71}We've all fared well under Jerhyn's }leadership. The town has remained }safe throughout this whole mess; and }yet the lad still seems very upset about }something.}
ElzixGossip7	88}Geglash is a fool who would fight his }own shadow if he could. Fighting's all }he ever thinks about!}
ElzixGossip8	74}Meshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise }enough to know silver from tin and }truth from dung, that's for sure.}
ElzixGossip9	65}Fara is a good woman. She seems very }sad, but seldom speaks of her past. }She's good to the poor and helps }people when she can. That makes her }all right in my book.}
ElzixGossip10	70}That Lysander's a grumpy old cuss. }You'd better not disturb him while he's }working on his potions, or... BOOM! }You could get blasted to the moon.}
WarrivAct2IntroGossip1	62}Now that Andariel is dead, I can return }and outfit the Rogues properly. Once }I've made some trades here, I'll be free }to head back to their Monastery. Let }me know if you want to travel along.}
WarrivAct2Gossip1	106}Caravans take people where they want }to go - until they get there.}
WarrivAct2Gossip2	80}By ship is the only way eastward from }here. I believe Captain Meshif has a }small trading vessel moored at the }docks.}
WarrivAct2Gossip3	70}There used to be a lot of brothels }here... I guess the troubles scared all }the women away, or maybe they're }'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.}
WarrivAct2Gossip4	53}That old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty }as they come. Years back, he made off }with a small fortune of my caravan's }wares. I certainly never expected to see }him so... domesticated.}
WarrivAct2Gossip5	57}Jerhyn has his father's strength and }wits. He's young, but he rules this }place with wisdom and care. I think }he'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided }we all survive this crisis.}
AtmaIntroGossip1	59}You'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've }suffered a loss recently, but that's not }your problem.} }It's a relief to see some proper warriors }come through here. My name is Atma. I }run the tavern here in Lut Gholein.}
AtmaGossip1	86}Evil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and }you may be our last hope...}
AtmaGossip2	56}This public house used to be quite lively, }until this plague of evil. Luckily, I've }managed to save away a tidy nest egg. }Unfortunately, I couldn't save }everything I cared for...}
AtmaGossip3	57}In addition to my public house, there }used to be several brothels doing }business here. When the troubles first }started in the desert, the harem guilds }sought sanctuary within the palace.} }Of course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll }bet they're finding many ways to repay }him for his protection.}
AtmaGossip4	70}Geglash may seem like a sot, but he's a }brave man. All this trouble has driven }him to drinking more than his usual.}
AtmaGossip5	64}Elzix and I have reached an }understanding over the years. He }sends travelers to me for drink and }entertainment, and I send them back to }him for a soft bed. The travelers often }trade their wares for lodging.}
AtmaGossip6	89}Meshif seldom patronizes my }establishment. I think he prefers to }stay out there on his leaky ship.}
AtmaGossip7	71}Oh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good }old man. He used to give me medicines }when... my son was ill.}
AtmaGossip8	78}Drognan is a very private person. He's }always studying ancient scrolls and }such. He may be a mystery to me }forever.}
GeglashIntroGossip1	57}Bah! I don't know why you people keep }pestering me.} }Greiz seems to have this place locked }down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't }have done the same! I've proven my }valor in combat plenty of times.}
GeglashIntroBarGossip1	43}Hey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya? }Ferocious as the wild beasts of the }north, that's what they say. I suppose }you've come to help save this city. You }needn't bother.} }Greiz seems to have this place locked }down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't }have done the same! I've proven my }valor in combat plenty of times.}
GeglashGossip1	46}Hey, I heard that you Barbarians can }wield multiple weapons at once. I never }learned to fight two-handed. Carrying a }sword and a wineskin at the same time }is all I can ever handle.}
GeglashGossip2	53}Sure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did }you hear about the harem guilds? They }were the only ones allowed to hide out }in the palace when the raids started!} }Ah... It figures.}
GeglashGossip3	64}I've killed plenty of those demons out in }the desert. It doesn't seem to slow }them down any, though... they just }keep coming back for more.}
GeglashGossip4	55}Have you found those big sand maggots }yet? Arrows and all that don't work so }well against them. Best thing is to hack }'em with a sword or such.}
GeglashGossip5	58}There are some ancient tombs out there }in the desert. You have to go pretty far }to find them, though. Rumor has it that }they're crawling with walking corpses }now.} }As if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers }weren't bad enough.}
GeglashGossip6	67}Yeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be }damned if I ever get on his ship. I don't }even like to drink water.}
GeglashGossip7	52}Jerhyn's been acting strange lately. I }can't imagine why he recalled the town }guards into the palace. If there is }something wrong in there, I hope he }doesn't expect me to handle it.}
GeglashGossip8	57}I've seen Fara defend herself against a }few drunken ruffians. She's got moves }I've never even seen before. Wherever }she's from, she sure learned how to }fight there.}
GeglashGossip9	83}I've got no time for old alchemists. }Lysander would be completely useless }in a real fight.}
MeshifIntroGossip1	63}Greetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this }ship here. I make port runs around the }Twin Seas and occasionally out to }Kingsport in Westmarch.} }I haven't sailed anywhere lately, }though... Jerhyn has ordered me to }stay docked here in case of emergency.}
MeshifIntroAmaGossip1	54}Greetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one }of your kind in many years.... It's good }to know that warriors of your caliber }are protecting this city.} }I'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I }make port runs around the Twin Seas }and occasionally out to Kingsport in }Westmarch.} }I haven't sailed anywhere lately, }though... Jerhyn has ordered me to }stay docked here in case of emergency.}
MeshifGossip1	62}I was wondering if you've heard any }news from Kurast? I know you }Amazons travel extensively. Have you }been there recently?} }Hmm... Well, I hope the port opens }soon. I need to get home to Kurast and }find out what's been happening there.}
MeshifGossip2	72}There's something Jerhyn's not telling }me, I just don't know what. To my eye, }things here in town don't look that bad, }especially since Warriv's caravan route }opened up.}
MeshifGossip3	65}I've been all around the seas in these }parts. It's dangerous sailing west this }time of year, though. Until the season }changes, the caravan through the }desert is the main trade route to }Westmarch.}
MeshifGossip4	75}My ship is the only way East from here. }Still, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may }not leave until the current crisis is }over.}
MeshifGossip5	65}Oh, I've known Elzix for years. He }always offers me a free room at his Inn }when I dock here, but I prefer the }comforts of my own cabin.}
MeshifGossip6	61}Warriv is a good friend. We've shared }many tales, he and I. If we had it all to }do over again, I believe we'd both be }explorers of some renown.}
MeshifGossip7	69}Greiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I }hope he can handle it if those things in }the desert decide to attack this town.}
MeshifGossip8	130}Atma serves a fine ale in her }establishment.}
MeshifGossip9	70}Hah! That braggart Geglash says he }fears neither man nor beast. Yet, when }I offer to take him out to sea, he }quakes with fear.}
MeshifGossip10	130}The lady Fara has a proud, noble air }about her.}
JerhynActIntroGossip1	41}Greetings, honored traveler. I am }Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid }you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm }glad to know that once again caravans }are free to travel through the Western }Pass.} }For some time now, we have been under }siege by an evil power that I cannot }identify. Strange... It all began when a }Dark Wanderer came this way, looking }for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one }knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper }of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain }to be far out in the desert.} }Now, my people whisper tales of the }dead rising from their tombs and }horrible creatures lurking amongst the }moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed }things which I cannot explain. I've }ordered the port closed and all trade }ships moored until I am sure that my }city is safe.} }Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an }important mission for you. Go see her }immediately. You'll find her on the }other side of town.} }Now, I must return to the palace. I }apologize, but I can't invite you in. }Things are... rather a mess right now.}
JerhynActIntroMoreGossip1	51}For trade in magic and the like, see }Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the }wisest man I know - without equal in }magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander }is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion }chemist.} }For travel back west, see Warriv, whom }you already know.} }Our own Fara is a fine and honest }armorer, and she can heal wounds as }well.} }Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also }have some items to trade.} }Greiz, the mercenary captain I hired to }secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps }order in town, as well.} }There are others here, too. I'm sure }you'll meet most of them. Just look }around...}
JerhynIntroGossip1	117}Things are getting worse by the hour. I }know everything looks fine, but trust }me, it isn't!}
JerhynGossip1	117}Things are getting worse by the hour. I }know everything looks fine, but trust }me, it isn't!}
JerhynGossip2	63}To any who aid me in the defense of Lut }Gholein, I pledge my support. Passage }East, wealth, honor - all are due to }those who help my city.}
JerhynGossip3	71}You seem very capable, but no offense }is intended when I say that I must }choose my confidants carefully. It }wouldn't do to have rumors sending }everyone into a panic.}
JerhynGossip4	87}Even though he was once a bandit, I }permitted Elzix to take over the Desert }Rain Inn. He has been quite civilized }ever since.}
JerhynGossip5	76}When you arrived, Warriv's caravan had }been long overdue. With all of the evil }that's arisen in the land, I'm surprised }he got through at all.}
JerhynGossip6	77}Meshif is an honorable man, but I fear }that he is growing impatient with me }about impounding his ship. I dare not }tell him what's really happening in this }city.}
JerhynGossip7	98}The woman, Atma, may have some }useful gossip for you. She can always }be found near her public house.}
FaraIntroGossip1	81}I know much about the ancient }religions. I was trained as a Paladin of }Zakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple }many years ago.}
FaraIntroPalGossip1	103}Welcome, brother Paladin.} }I am Fara. I was once a devout }champion of Zakarum.}
FaraGossip1	67}Perhaps, in time, you will play a part in }reclaiming our Order's honor and }spirit. You are an inspiration to me, }brother Paladin.}
FaraGossip2	60}The shrines in the desert are leftover }artifacts from the great Sin War that }ravaged these lands almost a thousand }years ago. They still function, but most }travelers believe them only to be }remnants of the distant past.}
FaraGossip3	54}I've no love for brothels, as they can }lead honorable men to do dishonorable }things. Since the local harems took up }hiding in the palace, however, there }seems to be a rise in foul tempers.}
FaraGossip4	66}When the Three Evils were bound ages }ago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was }moved to Kurast and bound by the }holiest of magics.}
FaraGossip5	79}Warriv may not remember me, but I }helped him out when I was a young }Paladin. There's no need for me to }remind him. The rewards for honor will }not come in this life.}
FaraGossip6	68}Greiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in }his heart, he will always be a }mercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to }those who have no loyalty to }themselves.}
FaraGossip7	90}Atma is a good, loving woman. But I }fear she will succumb to her despair }and hatred.}
FaraGossip8	95}Geglash is too confident in his abilities. }A warrior's true strength is in his }heart.}
FaraGossip9	94}Meshif is an honest man as far as I can }tell. He has never pestered me about }my past.}
LysanderIntroGossip1	61}How do I know I can trust you? Hmm?} }You may be as shifty as that pack rat, }Elzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you }need a potion, though, I suppose I can }make you one... for a price, of course.}
LysanderGossip1	109}Potions are delicate mixtures. They're }just as liable to go off in your face as }anything.}
LysanderGossip2	65}Ah... The sweetest desert flower - that's }Atma. Even my strongest brew can't }bring back her family, though.}
LysanderGossip3	86}There are some ancient enchanted }fountains in the desert that can heal }your wounds - if you drink enough from }them.}
LysanderGossip4	71}Oh. Deafness has its advantages, you }know. I'm no longer forced to overhear }the tedious gossip of others.}
LysanderGossip5	54}I never patronized the brothels, mind }you. But since those ladies took up }hiding in the palace, there certainly has }been less scenery to feast my eyes on.}
LysanderGossip6	95}Oh... I have great faith in Greiz. He }seems to have things well in hand.}
LysanderGossip7	90}I've traded my potions to Warriv many }times. Yes. They seem to fetch a good }price in the western lands.}
LysanderGossip8	71}I've sold many sea-sickness potions to }Meshif over the years. It seems that }many of his passengers don't take well }to the rocking of his ship on the open }seas.}
LysanderGossip9	58}Oh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase }minor love potions from me, hoping to }win the favors of the harem girls.} }But now that the girls have taken up }residence in the palace, he doesn't }come around here anymore. Well, }well... I've always said, 'alchemy is no }substitute for experience'.}
LysanderGossip10	57}Drognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of }mine. I help him find exotic spell }components and alchemical books from }time to time. I think he used to be a }sorcerer of great renown, but he }doesn't like to talk about his past.}
DrognanIntroGossip1	61}I've heard that you are responsible for }banishing Andariel back to the Burning }Hells. I'm impressed, stranger. That }couldn't have been easy.} }My name is Drognan and I know what }you're up against, my friend.} }You ought to look over my inventory of }items for trade.}
DrognanIntroSorGossip1	50}Welcome, young Sorceress, to Lut }Gholein. I hope your skills are a match }for the horrors that lie beyond the }city's walls. A mage of your limited }experience may find the evil too great }to withstand alone.} }My name is Drognan and I know what }you're up against, my friend.} }You ought to look over my inventory of }items for trade.}
DrognanGossip1	74}Many of the Mage Clans feel that }women shouldn't practice magic }openly. But since you've made it this }far, I must say that you have proven }your right to do so.}
DrognanGossip2	57}The Horadrim were a powerful Order, }although maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha }was one of their Order. And that }should tell you something.} }Any man who believes himself strong }enough to contain one of the Prime }Evils is in for a rude awakening, I }should think.}
DrognanGossip3	78}I have heard of your friend, Cain. He is }the last of the Horadrim. You would do }well to heed whatever advice he has to }give you.}
DrognanGossip4	53}Not long ago, one of my Vizjerei }comrades, who I believed had died in }Tristram, came to this city. He seemed }quite insane, so I dismissed much of }what he said.} }However, he was able to talk his way }into Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen }him since. I fear that fool may have }found something in the palace that led }to his doom.}
DrognanGossip5	68}I've been practicing magic for more }years than you could know. I'm older }than I look, though not so old that I }can't conjure up a few sparks.}
DrognanGossip6	67}Elzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of }course, he never tries to cheat me. He }knows what my magic skills can do.}
DrognanGossip7	86}Demons have spread throughout the }desert wasteland and threaten to }engulf our quiet port-city.}
DrognanGossip8	88}Meshif and his vessel should remain }here, lest we risk taking demonic }stowaways to other lands.}
DrognanGossip9	58}When the recent troubles began, Lord }Jerhyn came seeking my council. I }advised him to close the port and put }the town under strict watch.} }Lately, though, he's been occupied }within the palace. I doubt his whores }could divert him from his civic duties }for this long, though.}
DrognanGossip10	68}Lysander is harmless enough. We keep }each other company with our mutual }interests, yet I don't think he could }handle the enormity of our present }situation.}
CainAct2Gossip1	48}Greetings, my friend. Have you spoken }to Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable }leader for being such a young man. }Then again, the old blood has always }run strong in this land.}
CainAct2Gossip2	71}There is something about Fara that }troubles me. Her manner is strange for }a lonely desert-maid.}
CainAct2Gossip3	70}Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him }all the same.}
CainAct2Gossip4	59}I talked at length with Warriv as we }crossed the desert from Khanduras. He }has many fascinating tales of the }dangers in the desert. His experience }may be useful to you.}
CainAct2Gossip5	57}Meshif is an interesting man. Part of }him longs for the freedom of the open }seas... Yet his heart belongs in his }homeland.}
TyraelGossip1	42}I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. }But I did expect you earlier.} }I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here }to prevent Diablo from freeing his }brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, }Terror and Destruction roam free }throughout your world.} }Even now, they head towards the }Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very }heart of the Zakarum Temple. There }they hope to find their eldest brother, }Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was }imprisoned there ages ago.} }If the three Prime Evils unite, they will }be invincible. Though it is unclear as to }what their aims are, it is certain that }they must be stopped at all costs.} }I am broken and the energies that tie }me to this world are diminishing }rapidly.} }You must take up this quest and }prevent the Three Brothers from }reuniting. You must cross the sea and }search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.} }Now hurry, mortal... Time is running }out for all of us!}
Desert2GuardGossip1	50}Hey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if }you leave town now.}
A2Q1InitAtma	50}I don't expect this of you, but if you }want to help me, I would be grateful.} }In the sewers below our city, there lurks }a horrid creature that hungers for }human flesh. The creature has killed }many, including my son and my }husband.} }If you destroy it, I will reward you. }Please be careful though, that beast }has taken enough from us already.} }The sewer entrance is through the trap }door just up the street.}
A2Q1AfterInitGreiz	52}I've personally found some of that }devil's victims washed up out of the }sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or }a head, and their bodies have always }been skinned.} }At first the creature raided the town at }night... That's how Atma lost her }family. Now we've got him barricaded }in the sewers.} }You're safe up here on the surface, but }every now and again some fool wants }to be a hero and heads down to the }waste tunnels with a pig-sticker.}
A2Q1AfterInitElzix	68}I hear that the creature kills his victims }in order to hack off their limbs! I guess }that makes me a less likely candidate, }eh?}
A2Q1AfterInitWarrivAct2	84}I've heard tales of walking corpses out }in the desert at night, though I've never }actually seen one.}
A2Q1AfterInitGeglash	77}Hey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a }hole into your skull with my thumb.}
A2Q1AfterInitFara	54}I believe that the creature you refer to }is one of the ancient Horadric }mummies from the tombs that lie }buried beneath the desert sands. It is }unusual for one of his kind to be so far }away from his resting place. I sense in }this entity a restless and malevolent }spirit.}
A2Q1AfterInitAtma	62}The creature makes its lair in the }tunnels beneath this city. He butchered }my husband and son... I simply cannot }bear to talk about it...}
A2Q1AfterInitMeshif	63}There are two entrances to the sewers, }I believe. One of them is right near }here, down by the water beneath the }docks. I can see it from my ship, and }you can bet I keep an eye on it every }night.}
A2Q1AfterInitDrognan	53}Fara and I have been talking about the }creature recently. From my studies, I }have deduced that it is Radament the }Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy }that has for some reason left his tomb }to prey on mortals.} }I'm doing some more research now. If }you check back later, I may have some }more insight as to his nature.}
A2Q1AfterInitLysander	94}I hear that beast is after body parts. }Does he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!}
A2Q1AfterInitCain	48}The Horadrim used to mummify their }highest mages, and infuse them with }spells that would allow them to protect }their tombs, even after death.} }I have no idea why one of them would }be acting so malevolently. Perhaps }Drognan or Fara would know more }about this.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnWarrivAct2	90}Death is not afraid of the living, but the }living abhor death.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnMeshif	55}I noticed a rotting, human arm floating }in the harbor this morning. I suspected }foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't }seem too concerned since there haven't }been any folk reported missing lately.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnAtma	83}I am starting to have second thoughts }about my request... I couldn't bear the }thought of you losing your life on my }behalf.} }Please be careful.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnGreiz	69}We've been meaning to send an }organized group down there to kill that }thing, but it would be dangerous. We }just can't afford the chance of losing }any men with all the trouble that's }going on in the desert.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnGeglash	65}Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of }courage... Believe me, it doesn't help }for long.} }Drinks, barkeep!}
A2Q1EarlyReturnElzix	69}If you're going to fight that thing, use }some common sense. Be knowledgeable }about what harms the undead. Poison, }for instance, will have little effect.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnLysander	64}Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, }yes. Ooh, a foul creature...} }Some of my exploding potions should do }quite nicely against him. They usually }work well against the undead.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnDrognan	49}I've just been reading something }interesting about this sort of undead. }Apparently, certain Horadric funereal }priests altered the bodies of their dead }mages with magical and surgical }techniques -- often replacing body }parts with those of animals.} }This was thought to augment their }powers, and raise their status in the }afterlife.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnFara	68}Drognan told me something interesting }earlier today. It might explain why }Radament is so restless, and it might }have something to do with why he is }stealing human body parts.}
A2Q1EarlyReturnCain	41}The Horadric mummies were created to }protect the tombs, but Radament is far }from his burial chamber. Given the }aberrations that have been witnessed }lately, it comes as no surprise that }even the ancient guardian spells have }begun to unravel. Be wary of this as }you venture farther into the desert.}
A2Q1SuccessfulGreiz	76}You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite }a nice piece of work! If you ever need a }job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to }sign ya' up.}
A2Q1SuccessfulDrognan	52}From what you tell me, it would seem }that Radament was bent on the task of }reviving his own mummified corpse }with the flesh of the living.} }This is very unusual indeed. It takes an }incredible magic power to alter the }singular purpose of an undead mind.} }Perhaps there is a power at work here }which is beyond my ken.}
A2Q1SuccessfulLysander	61}Uh... Little of what I am able to hear is }of any value. Radament's death, }however, is news worth hearing. I'm }sure Atma will be glad to hear of this.}
A2Q1SuccessfulMeshif	62}Good job mate! At night out on my ship, }I was often awakened by that fiend's }awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.}
A2Q1SuccessfulGeglash	41}Whoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?} }I've fallen off many a barstool and no }one calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They }might go so far as to say, 'Geglash, }you've fallen!'}
A2Q1SuccessfulElzix	70}We ran into one of those old tomb }guardians when I ran with my bandits. }I know they aren't easy foes to face, so }you sure have my respect. Have you }told Atma yet?}
A2Q1SuccessfulWarrivAct2	142}Atma's been telling everyone what }you've done for her.}
A2Q1SuccessfulFara	102}As you have helped Atma and all of us, }so shall I help you.}
A2Q1SuccessfulCain	57}If you haven't already, tell Atma that }Radament is dead. It may help to ease }the weight of her mourning.}
A2Q1SuccessfulAtma	50}They say that the taste of vengeance is }bittersweet, but I find it to my liking. } }In addition to my undying gratitude, I }have spoken on your behalf with the }rest of the townspeople. The }merchants have agreed to show their }gratitude by offering their wares and }services at lower rates.} }Oh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. }You'll find him in front of the palace.}
A2Q2EarlyReturnScrollCain	37}Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a }fortunate turn of events...} }As the last living Horadrim, I alone have }knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read }the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...} }The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal }within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off }his Burial Chamber from the mortal }realm. Those same Mages also crafted }fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued }them with the special power to open }the Chamber's hidden door.} }After nearly losing one to the thievery }of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all }the Horadric Staves into two parts - }wooden shaft and metal headpiece - }hiding them separately to safeguard }them.} }The Horadrim foresaw our current }plight and designed the hiding places }to reveal themselves to worthy heroes }like you.} }Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff }and unite them using a Horadric Cube. }Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial }Chamber.}
A2Q2EarlyReturnCapCain	50}The Viper Amulet you bear is actually }the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!} }Yes... You have an uncanny knack for }finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of }course, you'll have to use a Horadric }Cube to combine the headpiece with the }shaft.}
A2Q2EarlyReturnStaveCain	56}The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my }friend. You have discovered the shaft }portion of a Horadric Staff.} }I trust you know how to use a Horadric }Cube to unite the shaft with its }headpiece.}
A2Q2EarlyReturnCubeCain	40}You have quite a treasure there in that }Horadric Cube. According to Horadric }lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric }Staff.} }To do it - use the Cube as you would a }scroll. When the Cube opens, place }both pieces of the Staff into it and use }the Cube's transmute power.} }You'll be pleased to know that the Cube }has other alchemical uses as well...} }Six gems plus one sword transmute into }a socketed long sword.} }You may also transmute two quivers of }crossbow bolts into one quiver of }arrows, while two quivers of arrows }yield one quiver of bolts.} }I must leave it to you to discover other }formulae.}
A2Q2SuccessfulStaffCain	46}Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.} }Carry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. }Find within the Tomb the chamber }whose floor is inset with the Circle of }Seven Symbols.} }Place the Staff into the receptacle you }find there. That will open the secret }passage into Tal Rasha's Burial }Chamber.} }But, be prepared for a fight - you'll }likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy }Baal.}
A2Q3AfterInitJerhyn	110}My astrologers failed to predict this }eclipse. You should seek Drognan's }advice.}
A2Q3AfterInitGreiz	71}This midday darkness reeks of foul }magic! My men and I are trying to keep }the peace, but this kind of thing really }scares people.}
A2Q3AfterInitElzix	65}Two men arrived late last night bearing }a story about evil magic. They said }they saw a gathering of giant snake }creatures performing some arcane }ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men }of the desert.}
A2Q3AfterInitWarrivAct2	72}The sun has grown disgusted with the }terrible deeds it must shine upon each }day. Damnation is upon us all.}
A2Q3AfterInitAtma	121}Drognan, the wizard, will have some }idea as to what is happening.}
A2Q3AfterInitGeglash	100}This whole place is one big ale fog.}
A2Q3AfterInitFara	70}This unnatural nightfall is no doubt }caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might }know what we are dealing with.}
A2Q3AfterInitLysander	65}Claw Vipers! This outer darkness }mirrors the inner blackness of their }souls. It is they who have eclipsed the }sun, I'll wager. They are a venomous }band.}
A2Q3AfterInitDrognan	77}I've been researching this lengthy }eclipse and I believe it to be the work }of Claw Vipers.} }Find their temple beneath the desert }sands and you may find the source of }this curse.}
A2Q3AfterInitMeshif	76}This permanent darkness is very }unsettling. Hmmm... It would make }navigation by stars easier for me, }though.}
A2Q3AfterInitCain	62}Drognan may have some advice on this }matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with }him myself.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnJerhyn	130}This eclipse is a definite manifestation }of evil.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnGreiz	73}Don't worry! My men and I have an iron }grip on this town. If those cursed Claw }Vipers are plotting anything against }us, we'll be prepared for 'em.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnWarrivAct2	73}The calculated coldness of the reptilian }brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny }adversaries.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnGeglash	49}It's strange when the morning after the }night before... is still the same night.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnMeshif	105}I've had about enough of this darkness. }I don't even know what day it is }anymore.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnFara	77}The Claw Vipers practice evil magic. }They have also been known to kidnap }travelers and sacrifice them to their }dark gods.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnLysander	82}Well... I don't know much about the }habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. }Drognan will probably know something }about the nature of the magic at work.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnDrognan	51}I've discovered a reference to a similar }eclipse several hundred years ago. It }says that some desert-dwelling snake }demons had erected an evil altar, }which caused the sun to go black.} }Perhaps we are dealing with something }similar here. Look for an altar in the }Claw Viper temple.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnElzix	94}I usually charge for rooms by the night.} }But I may have to soon change that.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnCain	57}The source of this spell is probably a }magical altar. It will not be enough to }kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the }spell you must destroy the altar.}
A2Q3EarlyReturnAtma	80}I was going to go to bed, but then I }realized that I have no idea what time }it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for }all I know.}
A2Q3SuccessfulJerhyn	96}The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm }beginning to like you, traveler.}
A2Q3SuccessfulGreiz	219}I'm glad that's over with!}
A2Q3SuccessfulElzix	74}Ahh... It takes but one eye to revel in }the beauty of our restored sun.}
A2Q3SuccessfulGeglash	60}So, this is daylight... It's over-rated.}
A2Q3SuccessfulWarrivAct2	80}With renewed daylight, one may gather }the wits that were scattered about like }restrictive undergarments in the }darkness.}
A2Q3SuccessfulMeshif	130}So... Did you plunder any booty?}
A2Q3SuccessfulAtma	132}You have done well to restore light to }our world.}
A2Q3SuccessfulFara	87}Drognan seems to have taken you into }his confidence. This is good, for you }will benefit from his wisdom.}
A2Q3SuccessfulLysander	69}Ahhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical }artifacts. Did you happen to find one in }their temple?}
A2Q3SuccessfulDrognan	69}You did well in destroying the Claw }Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun }returned to its former glory.}
A2Q3SuccessfulCain	48}I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and }I sense that he is becoming more and }more agitated by something. You }should try to talk to him again.} }If he still won't take you into his }confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit }more. I gather that his respect for you }is growing.}
A2Q4InitDrognan	41}I've been researching the old records, }trying to find the location of Tal }Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found }the Tomb, itself, I may have a good }lead for you.} }The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, }built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere }around here. He was a powerful }spellcaster and kept demons as slaves }within the Sanctuary. He kept a close }eye on great events, too -- such as the }imprisonment of Baal within Tal }Rasha's Tomb.} }If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, }I'm sure that it would hold some clue }as to the Tomb's location. Though I }doubt Horazon is still alive, you must }proceed with caution. There's no telling }what could be waiting inside.} }When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, }he asked that I send you to him. }Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance }or the like.}
A2Q4AfterInitFara	46}Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He }believed that he could bend Evil forces }to his will. What he didn't know was }that Evil uses man, not the reverse.} }The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol }of man's ability to triumph over other }worldly forces. The Church of Light, }however, cites him as an example of }man's folly.}
A2Q4AfterInitGreiz	89}The only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the }harem girls that have been hiding there }since the troubles began.}
A2Q4AfterInitElzix	62}An 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the }palace? I'd heard that there were some }underground cellar levels that Jerhyn }used as chambers for his treasure and }such, but no Arcane Sanctuary.}
A2Q4AfterInitJerhyn	44}When the troubles began here, I allowed }the terrified Harem guilds to join me }within the safety of the palace. All was }fine, until one night...} }Screams echoed up the stairwells from }the harem. My guards arrived to find }the poor girls being slaughtered by a }merciless band of hell-spawned }demons. My brave guardsmen tried to }push the demons back into the }mysterious rift from which they came.} }Ever since, my men have fought a losing }battle. Demons have continued to pour }through the rift into the palace. }Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his }mercenaries to help protect the rest of }my fair city.} }Drognan believes that the Arcane }Sanctuary lies buried underneath this }palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the }site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.} }My palace is open to you now... Take }care.}
A2Q4AfterInitCain	45}I very much doubt that Horazon still }lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed }great power and influence over }demons, but even that may not have }been enough in the end. One of his }notoriety cannot easily remove himself }from the vengeful reach of Hell.}
A2Q4AfterInitGeglash	60}Look, look... I'm just about as tough and }arrogant as they come, but you'd never }catch me trying to tame a demon for a }pet. That's just asking for a lot of }trouble.}
A2Q4AfterInitAtma	75}Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds }awful! Even if you find a way into it, }what makes you think you'll be able to }leave again?}
A2Q4AfterInitWarrivAct2	73}A careful caravan gives wide berth to }sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, }let him remain so.}
A2Q4AfterInitLysander	49}Horazon found it necessary to lock }himself up for all time, just to protect }himself from those angry demons. }Such is the fate of one who practices }the summoning arts... that, or eternal }damnation. There's old summoners and }bold summoners, but no old, bold }summoners.}
A2Q4AfterInitDrognan	42}Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon }rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage }clan. Horazon used the knowledge of }the Vizjerei to summon and control }demons from Hell.} }Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon }feared that the Lords of Hell would }punish him for enslaving their }brethren. Thus, the Summoner created }for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.} }He believed that his Sanctuary would }not only protect him from Hell's }vengeance, but also allow him to }continue his studies free from the }ravages of time and disease.} }Horazon had crafted many wondrous }scrying devices through which he }observed the events of the world }outside. It is certain that he took }careful study of Tal Rasha's }imprisonment and recorded the }location of his forgotten Tomb.} }The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to }have been constructed here in Lut }Gholein. An entrance may be hidden }somewhere in the palace, as that }building is very old, and was once a }Vizjerei fortress.}
A2Q4AfterInitMeshif	57}Ahh... The legend of Horazon is an old }one, especially around these parts. You }wouldn't believe the feats and strange }events that are attributed to him.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnElzix	63}I understand that you've been talking to }Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first }in a long while... since the trouble }began, actually.} }Do us a favor and try to find out what's }got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?}
A2Q4EarlyReturnJerhyn	48}There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, }I believe... who visited me almost a }year ago. He was very interested in the }history of this site, and he seemed }particularly fascinated with the palace }architecture.} }I gave him a tour. When he found the }ancient seals over a passageway in the }cellar, he became very agitated. He }asked for some time alone to study }them, and I granted it.} }Shortly after, he left with no further }word and I never saw him again. Odd... }Don't you think?}
A2Q4EarlyReturnGreiz	61}What's got you so occupied in the }palace? Don't tell me you're finding the }Harems more compelling than killing }demons? That would be out of }character for one such as yourself.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnDrognan	63}I am certain that you will find the }information you need when you find }Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it }quickly, for Diablo may be getting }closer to freeing his brother as we }speak.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnLysander	68}Huh? The horizon is always out of }reach, you should know that. Oh, }Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh.} }Yes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, }but... total lunatic.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnFara	57}Even a sanctuary such as Horazon's }can be breached by the tentacles of }Evil. Such a haven could have become a }chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be }wary of what you may unleash!}
A2Q4EarlyReturnGeglash	49}All my years of brawling, of pummeling }both the unsuspecting and the }deserving, have yielded two insights. }You can either fight or you can run. All }other strategies are variations of }these.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnMeshif	77}So... Now that you're such a pal of }Jerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can }set sail one of these days? I'm running }out of patience.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnAtma	87}So you've been in the palace, have you? }Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that }place locked up so tight?}
A2Q4EarlyReturnWarrivAct2	87}Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt }you with dung if you mock it.}
A2Q4EarlyReturnCain	51}I've been thinking about the problems in }Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has }occurred to you as well...} }If those cellar passageways lead to the }Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where }the demons came from. Horazon's }haven must have been breached!}
A2Q4SuccessfulNarrator	37}Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will }find it through the Portal. But know }that the glowing glyphs recorded here }in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs }of the six False Tombs.} }The missing Seventh Sign marks the }Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim }he might be called the foremost.} }It was a shining - but brief - moment for }the Mage Clans when they set aside }their differences and worked together }against the common enemy.} }The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the }Three across the desolate Empires of }the East, and even into the uncharted }lands of the West, leaving the }Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.} }Presuming the Three to be vanquished, }the Horadrim's unstable fellowship }began to dissipate. Abandoning their }sacred charge to safeguard the three }Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans }began to squabble amongst each other }over petty differences.} }Their conflicts not only dissolved their }brotherhood, but strengthened the }Evils which they had buried beneath the }cold earth.}
A2Q4SuccessfulGriez	59}Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! }The palace guards have been fighting }off demons from the cellar. How could }that happen without my knowledge?}
A2Q4SuccessfulJerhyn	62}I thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also }glad that you found something you }were looking for. The journal should }help you find the True Tomb of Tal }Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to }get there before Diablo.} }Go now. And good luck.}
A2Q4SuccessfulDrognan	55}You have found Horazon's Journal. }Excellent... But, I must caution you.} }The mark of the True Tomb of Tal }Rasha, is sought, if not already known, }by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the }implications of that.}
A2Q4SuccessfulElzix	71}News of the tragedy in the palace is }spreading fast. How awful! And to }think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn }and his guards were in there playing }with the harem girls.}
A2Q4SuccessfulGeglash	60}Hah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the }palace. I would've saved those girls and }kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits }o' Hell!}
A2Q4SuccessfulMeshif	52}So... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. }Well... I guess I can see why he wanted }me to stay, though... I'm just glad it }didn't come to that. Now he tells me to }wait some more, in case you need to }get out of here.} }Well, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll }mention me in the epic ballads, eh?}
A2Q4SuccessfulWarrivAct2	67}Well, the news going around town is }very unsettling. Apparently, we were in }more danger than anyone thought.} }Good work friend... you may have saved }all our skins.}
A2Q4SuccessfulFara	64}Faith is stronger than any armor. The }shield will protect the body, but Faith }will strengthen the courageous heart.}
A2Q4SuccessfulLysander	55}Horazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, }well... Glad you found it. Such a shame }about those poor harem girls, huh? I }shall miss them deeply... I mean their }conversations, of course.}
A2Q4SuccessfulAtma	62}Oh, those poor women! Will the }slaughter never end? Thank you once }again for protecting our city.}
A2Q4SuccessfulCain	57}You must move quickly now, friend, for }Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding }what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal }Rasha before he frees the Lord of }Destruction.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnGreiz	89}That guy really talks like that? Sounds }like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy }or that's some impostor.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnJerhyn	57}The man you describe is probably not }Horazon.} }He sounds like the very mage who came }around here a while ago. He was very }curious about this palace and seemed }especially interested in the seal on the }passageway in the cellar. He left }shortly after that. I wonder how he got }down there? The seal was never }broken...} }That mage spoke a great deal to }Drognan. Why don't you ask him about }it?}
A2Q5EarlyReturnDrognan	47}Yes... The man you speak of sounds like }the mage who came here many months }ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo }in the passages beneath Tristram.} }No doubt the fool wandered into }Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever }was left of his ravaged mind. He is }beyond salvation. } }It is possible that the fool has been }possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If }that's true, then you'd better put an }end to his tortured existence.} }Once done, I believe the demons who }were summoned and imprisoned within }the Sanctuary will cease to exist as }well.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnLysander	57}Ah, yes. I remember. There was a... }fellow around here many months ago }who asked almost as many questions }about Horazon as you.} }So... He discovered enough to assume }Horazon's place in the Arcane }Sanctuary, huh? What a fool!}
A2Q5EarlyReturnMeshif	72}Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well }aware of the phenomenon of a false }Horazon.} }Sorry, just a little joke.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnWarrivAct2	99}There's nothing more dreadful than a }powerful being driven by a frayed }mind.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnAtma	105}You always seem to find the worst }trouble. I don't know how you handle it.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnGeglash	38}So! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be }surprised if he wasn't. All those }centuries without ale would drive }anyone to drink... but then you couldn't }drink. And that would drive you to }drink... Hah?... What was the question?}
A2Q5EarlyReturnFara	63}Hmmm... That doesn't sound like }Horazon. I'll agree that he may have }gone mad, but from what you tell me, I }don't think that's the case. Talk to }Drognan... he may know more than I.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnElzix	106}Ugh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.} }Just kill him and get on with your }business.}
A2Q5EarlyReturnCain	45}The appearance of the mage you }describe sounds like one I met back in }Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight }against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. }Perhaps, this is one of them.} }You know, fate seems to have frowned }upon all of the heroes who confronted }that terrible Evil. Take care or the }same may happen to you.}
A2Q5SuccessfulGreiz	76}So, Horazon's been dead for some time. }I take it you at least found what you }were looking for.}
A2Q5SuccessfulGeglash	60}The way I see it... Well, it's all pretty }blurry.}
A2Q5SuccessfulJerhyn	63}The demonic force that was emanating }from the corrupted Sanctuary has }dissipated. I thank you greatly for your }help. Now, we can look to rebuilding }our lives.} }All will be for nothing, though, if you do }not stop the greater Evil which is }rapidly gaining ground.}
A2Q5SuccessfulDrognan	83}Larger forces are moving inexorably }towards us. You must now make haste }to the Tombs.}
A2Q5SuccessfulElzix	65}You make me long for the days of glory. }When I had both hands, both eyes and }more of a foot...}
A2Q5SuccessfulWarrivAct2	84}I guess you'll be heading to the Tombs }now? I hear that they're in the deepest }desert regions.}
A2Q5SuccessfulMeshif	100}Well! You've got what you're after. Now }get a move on before it's too late.}
A2Q5SuccessfulLysander	103}Huhhh... Such is always the fate of }those who meddle with evil.}
A2Q5SuccessfulAtma	89}You're more the hero than I could have }dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us }after all.}
A2Q5SuccessfulFara	74}I feel no pity for that would-be }Summoner. His terrible ambition for }demonic power was his undoing. You }merely hastened the inevitable.}
A2Q5SuccessfulCain	48}I hope that this false Summoner found }peace in death. Unfortunately, it is }more likely that he will be dragged }down into Hell by the demons he was }bound to.} }Let this be a lesson to you... Demonic }magic is a quick path, but its powers }are seductive and deadly.}
A2Q6InitJerhyn	45}I have heard of your many deeds of skill }and bravery. I feel I can trust you with }something I have been hesitant to }speak of...} }Drognan and I have concluded that the }Dark Wanderer who passed through }here recently was Diablo, himself! }Drognan believes that Diablo is }searching the desert for the secret }tomb where the great Horadric mage, }Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.} }You must find Diablo and put an end to }the terrible evil that has fallen upon }our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to }have some helpful advice for you as to }how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.} }It may take you quite some time to find }The Tomb. May you be ready when you }do.}
A2Q6AfterInitJerhyn	53}It is well-known that there are seven }great Horadric tombs hidden beneath }the sands in the furthest reaches of }the desert. One of them surely must be }Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore }each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's }exact location.} }Of course, Diablo is searching for the }Tomb as well... No one can guess as to }what terrors he has unleashed in his }search.}
A2Q6AfterInitElzix	59}So... You're going to search for the }Seven Tombs, huh? Don't you know }that they're just desert legends passed }between merchants and travelers? No }one really believes that they exist.}
A2Q6AfterInitWarrivAct2	61}Be very careful, my friend. I think I've }seen enough recently not to doubt that }these Tombs exist. And if they do, }they're most certainly guarded by }terrible creatures.}
A2Q6AfterInitAtma	67}I've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal }Rasha, but I thought they were just old }tales meant to scare young children.}
A2Q6AfterInitGeglash	59}Ohh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... }But... umm... I don't like all that living }dead stuff.}
A2Q6AfterInitMeshif	84}I'm sorry, I can't help you much here. }Now, if the tombs were across the }ocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.}
A2Q6AfterInitFara	57}Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies }imprisoned within his tomb, forever }struggling to keep the Lord of }Destruction bound. His was a selfless }act, although perhaps foolhardy.}
A2Q6AfterInitLysander	56}When Tal Rasha chose to embody the }spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to }wrestle eternally against the will of the }greater Evil. Look around you and ask }yourself, 'Has the battle been won or }lost?'}
A2Q6AfterInitDrognan	55}Tal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the }desert among six others. Tal Rasha's }symbol marks the True Tomb. If you }want to know what that symbol is, you }should be able to find it within the }legendary Arcane Sanctuary.}
A2Q6AfterInitCain	57}Diablo nears his goal. We have little }time to lose.} }Remember, my friend, that Andariel }gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. }It would be prudent to assume that the }other Evils will attempt to aid their }master as well.}
A2Q6AfterInitGreiz	106}If you're going into the deep desert, why }not hire a few of my men to watch your }back?}
A2Q6SuccessfulJerhyn	47}You have done very well. Few could have }come this far, let alone discover the }True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, }I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded }your grasp. This is most unfortunate...} }If you wish to travel East, I have }authorized Meshif to give you passage }by sea. I imagine he should be very }anxious to leave by now.} }Good luck on your quest, and thank you }again for saving my beloved city. You }will always be welcome in Lut Gholein, }my friend.}
A2Q6SuccessfulElzix	71}I heard that Diablo has managed to }best you, at least for the time being. I }hope you catch up with him soon, and }send him back to Hell for good!}
A2Q6SuccessfulLysander	70}I'm sorry things didn't turn out as you }had hoped. Go and remember us }fondly. You know, you bothered me far }less than most.}
A2Q6SuccessfulAtma	64}You have proven to be the greatest of }heroes, and I am honored to call you }friend. Thank you for bringing peace to }our lives again.}
A2Q6SuccessfulWarrivAct2	68}Never fear, my friend. You did the best }you could.} }I suspect that Diablo and Baal are now }heading east, towards Kurast. You'll }find them... I know you will.}
A2Q6SuccessfulFara	46}This is terrible news! Baal is in }possession of one of mankind's most }powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror }guides his path. They must be stopped, }for I am sure they mean to free their }elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of }Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the }corrupted city of Kurast.} }I fear you are walking into a great evil, }but your faith can save you. May you }walk in the light always.}
A2Q6SuccessfulGeglash	54}You're an inspiration! And such a hero }that it makes me look twice as bad...} }Ahh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some }glory for us little guys, huh?}
A2Q6SuccessfulDrognan	51}This is a serious setback... It is most }unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been }consumed by Baal's destructive }influence. There are many secrets }known to the Horadrim, which could be }used by Baal against us.} }You must travel east by sea to Kurast }and stop Diablo and Baal before they }free their eldest brother, Mephisto.} }Hahh... The lands of the eastern Empire }are not the same as they used to be. }There has been little word for some }time.} }Speed is of the essence. Go quickly, my }friend. May the fates smile on you.}
A2Q6SuccessfulMeshif	82}Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to }Kurast. I haven't been there for several }years, but rumor has it that things are }pretty grim.}
A2Q6SuccessfulGreiz	51}I've heard that your foe got away from }you this time. Well, look at it this way... }you've got the demons on the run. If }you're going to be leaving, then... Well, }thanks for your help.}
A2Q6SuccessfulCain	39}The Archangel Tyrael was the one who }gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim }two hundred and sixty years ago.} }It is highly unusual for the forces of }Heaven to so directly interfere with }man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to }act of his own volition. We have never }been able to discern why.} }Perhaps, he goes against the consensus }of Heaven because he doubts our }ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, }he sees more threat than his peers.} }Where the actions of Hell often seem }straightforwardly bent on destruction, }the motives of Heaven are }unfathomable.} }Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal }must be stopped before they join with }their brother, Mephisto. If the three }Prime Evils unite once again, the world }as we know it will be no more.}
NatalyaIntroGossip1	48}Greetings, hero. I've heard of your }exploits and... I'm quite impressed. }Very few mortals are capable of }dealing with the Three and their }minions as you have.} }My name is Natalya. I am a hunter of }Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to }hunt down corrupted sorcerers.} }If I could, I would gladly join your quest }to stop the Three. But I must wait here }for further news. I can't predict what }will happen, but the danger is greater }than we can know.} }Until I receive my orders, I'll assist you }with the information I have.}
NatalyaGossip1	74}Asheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking }mage, but I'd wager she's never faced }true Evil.} }Pampering drunken mercenaries is one }thing, but standing face to face with a }hell-spawned demon is another.}
NatalyaGossip2	69}I've heard the name of Deckard Cain }many times. He's the last of the }Horadrim, and thus, I must honor him. }You must be powerful, indeed, if one }such as he accompanies you.}
NatalyaGossip3	100}Hratli is a master craftsman. My Order }could make use of one with his unique }skills.}
NatalyaGossip4	67}My Order has been keeping watch over }Ormus for many years, now. He seems }to champion the cause of good, but }who knows what shadow lurks within }his soul?}
CainAct3IntroGossip1	45}I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for }many years. But I never would have }imagined it could be so corrupted.} }Certainly, this must be Mephisto's work! }You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo }and Baal are still out there and you }must find them.}
CainAct3Gossip1	62}Seeing his homeland in such a state }must be horrifying to Meshif. I'm }surprised he's willing to remain here in }order to help you.}
CainAct3Gossip2	82}Asheara seems like a very tough }woman. I'd be careful around her if I }were you.}
CainAct3Gossip3	53}Drognan told me of Hratli when we were }in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves }magic into his forge and produces }mystical weapons and armor.} }His skills could be quite useful to you. }
CainAct3Gossip4	44}Judging from his dress and strange }markings, I would guess that Ormus is }from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet }none of the others here seem to know }that he is a sorcerer.} }The Taan were once as powerful as the }Vizjerei clan, but their studies were }even more secretive. I wonder what }he's hiding.}
CainAct3Gossip5	49}Have you met, Natalya? She appears to }be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a }secret order that has been around for }centuries... almost as long as the }Horadrim, itself.} }Her presence here makes me uneasy, }for they are traditionally sworn to hunt }down Magi who have betrayed the trust }of their order.} }I wonder why she is here.}
CainAct3Gossip6	73}Ormus would like you to think him mad. }Better to watch his actions than listen }to his words.}
HratliActIntroGossip1	33}Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come }willingly to this ancient city anymore. I }hope you brought your wits with you, }for sanity is in short supply here.} }My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer }skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure }to help you... I don't have many }customers these days.} }As you can see, the populace has been }brutally decimated by the forces of }Mephisto. The canals run red with }blood and demons roam the land.} }The wretched jungle-hell has already }reclaimed much of Kurast. The only }safety you'll find is here at the }dockside, where a magical warding }holds the jungle evils at bay... but I }don't know how long it will last.} }To make matters worse, the Children of }Zakarum are in league with the forces }of Mephisto. The Zakarum have }concentrated their power in the Temple }City of Travincal, located within Kurast }deep in the jungle wilderness.} }It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I }say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are }nothing more than the twisted puppets }of a hidden hand.}
HratliActIntroSorGossip1	33}Welcome to Kurast, young Sorceress. }Few come willingly to this ancient city }anymore.

I don't have many }customers these days.} }Though my own magic is only useful for }making enchanted weapons, I'll bet }yours will put an end to this terrible }evil once and for all.

But I }say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are }nothing more than the twisted puppets }of a hidden hand.}
HratliGossip1	48}You're very brave to have come here. In }the old days, mages who didn't belong }to one of the great Mage Clans were }hunted down as renegades. But now, }the Mage Clans have little authority.}
HratliGossip2	53}Within the Temple City stands a tower }built long ago by the Horadrim to }imprison the... Well, you'll discover }more about it soon enough.}
HratliGossip3	60}If you are another follower of Zakarum, }I've told you people before I don't want }your Towering Spire or anything else }you have to sell!}
HratliGossip4	74}Some find my prices unreasonable. That }is because I am unreasonable.}
HratliGossip5	76}You'll find that the Zakarumites have }the persistence of zombies, but without }the charisma.}
HratliGossip6	60}Asheara leads the mercenary company }known as the Iron Wolves. You can hire }some of them, but many are occupied }securing the dockside.}
HratliGossip7	74}Alkor is a potion dealer given over to a }life steeped in ceaseless study and }dissipation.}
HratliGossip8	58}Ormus is a man of many mysteries. I }sense strong magic about him, but he's }never spoken of it to me.}
HratliGossip9	49}I trust you already know Meshif. But did }you know that he was born and raised }here?} }I suspect that like many of us his spirit }is near broken at the sight of Kurast's }decline. Only our brand of gallows }humor saves us from utter despair.}
HratliGossip10	55}This, Cain, whom you brought with you. }He has the bearing of great power, yet }I sense no magic about him. He is an }enigma to me.}
HratliGossip11	49}Natalya is a quiet one. She arrived here }about a week ago and has pretty much }kept to herself. She's inquired about }my weapons a few times, so I assume }that she's a warrior of some sort.}
MeshifAct3IntroGossip1	51}Well, I gave you my word, and brought }you here as promised.} }But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd }never returned to this accursed place. }This fetid jungle can't be the fair }Kurast I left behind.} }I don't know what all this evil is, my }friend, but it's obvious that you must }stop it. I only pray that you can before }the jungle consumes the last vestiges }of my beloved homeland.}
MeshifAct3IntroBarGossip1	47}Being a Barbarian, I'm sure you've seen }many strange sights in the northlands.} }But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd }never returned to this accursed place. }This fetid jungle can't be the fair }Kurast I left behind!} }I don't know what all this evil is, my }friend, but it's obvious that you must }stop it. I only pray that you can before }the jungle consumes the last vestiges }of my beloved homeland.} }If this evil isn't contained, it could }spread north to your homeland, too. }Then the whole world would fall under }the shadow of the Three.}
MeshifAct3Gossip1	63}It takes great courage and generosity }to defend a land and a people that are }not your own. Perhaps, when this curse }is lifted, my people can do something }for yours in return.}
MeshifAct3Gossip2	72}I shouldn't have boasted so much about }Kurast on the journey here. Oh... Much }has changed since I left.}
MeshifAct3Gossip3	99}The dockside is apparently the only }civilized area left in Kurast.}
MeshifAct3Gossip4	88}If you are planning to carry on your }wild ways here, you may need the }assistance of Asheara's Iron Wolf }mercenaries.}
MeshifAct3Gossip5	75}Your companion, Cain, must have }known that he would be in grave }danger here. You are great, indeed, to }elicit such loyalty.}
MeshifAct3Gossip6	81}Hratli seems to be the only one left here }with any common sense. Yet how }sensible is it to remain here?}
MeshifAct3Gossip7	80}I went to speak with old Alkor, but I }disturbed his studies. He doesn't seem }to like visitors.}
MeshifAct3Gossip8	73}Trying to get information out of Ormus }is like straining water from a rock. His }damned riddles are almost as }confusing as our current state of }affairs.}
MeshifAct3Gossip9	75}That woman, Natalya, seems to be }waiting for something important to }happen. She's a strange one, I think.}
MeshifAct3Gossip10	68}All through my childhood, Kurast was a }paradise. The once perfumed air now }reeks of putrefaction.}
AshearaIntroGossip1	54}Hello, there. You must be a great }adventurer to risk coming here.} }My name's Asheara, and I lead the }mercenary band of mages known as }the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting }down demons in the jungle for months, }but no matter how many of them we }kill, they just keep comin'.

If you piss them off, }they can be worse than those monsters }out in the jungle.}

If you piss them off, }they can be worse than those monsters }out in the jungle.}
AshearaGossip1	66}Your skills are unique indeed. They are }neither sorcery, nor physical, but seem }to be a harmonious blend of the two. }The Iron Wolves could learn much from }your kind.}
AshearaGossip2	160}Why fight fair, when you can hire some }of us?}
AshearaGossip3	107}No one comes to Kurast anymore }without good reason.  You must be }seeking fame and fortune.}
AshearaGossip4	137}The Iron Wolves and I have made a }good living around here lately.}
AshearaGossip5	110}The jungle can take you down fast. Try }to avoid getting trapped out there if }you can.}
AshearaGossip6	90}Hratli may be a bit too clever for his }own good. Still, I'd trust his work }anytime.}
AshearaGossip7	77}Hratli thinks he's so funny. The other }day he said, 'Asheara, I don't recognize }you without that big gash on your }face.'}
AshearaGossip8	97}Meshif says he used to live here. I'm }surprised he came back. I'll bet he }wishes he hadn't.}
AshearaGossip9	78}I invited Natalya to join the Iron Wolves }and she began lecturing me about the }'dangers of magic'. Who the hell does }she think she is, anyway?}
AlkorIntroGossip1	61}Damn it, I wish you people would just }leave me alone! I...} }Oh, you're new here, aren't you?} }I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in }potions and salves, and I can sell you }some if you really need them.} }But don't make a habit of coming here. I }don't like to be disturbed while I'm }studying!}
AlkorIntroNecGossip1	48}Damn it, I wish you people would just }leave me alone! I...} }Oh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you? }I've heard that your kind use powerful }potions and such to wake the dead and }control spirits.

I dabble in }potions and salves, myself, and I can }sell you some if you really need them.} }...Feel free to drop by anytime.}
AlkorGossip1	55}Even I can tell that the evil in the jungle }is growing. I hope you survive out }there, my pasty friend. I'd still like to }discuss what components are best }used in necromantic potions.}
AlkorGossip2	151}Care to take a gander at my Grimoire?}
AlkorGossip3	90}I've never claimed that you'd live forever }after trying one of my potions! Merely }that you might look as though you had.}
AlkorGossip4	105}I keep a library of tomes - heretical, }exegetical, hermeneutical and }pharmaceutical.}
AlkorGossip5	50}There was a very fat man here recently }asking after the Golden Bird of Ku }Y'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept }muttering about ashes. I would imagine }one Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about }the same as another, wouldn't you?}
AlkorGossip6	150}I hope you don't object to my badgering }the witless.}
AlkorGossip7	115}You came here with Meshif? That old }'tour-guide to the stupid'!} }I'm surprised you made it here in one }piece.}
AlkorGossip8	98}Oh, Asheara's a good customer. She }buys a potion of manliness from me }every week.}
AlkorGossip9	82}Hratli's only good for making his silly }magic weapons. It's not like he's got }the stones to actually go out and use }them on anything.}
AlkorGossip10	88}Oh, Ormus has been talking in riddles }for years. I think he does it to cover up }the fact that he's got nothing }intelligent to say.}
AlkorGossip11	52}Yes, Natalya is a cute girl. However, I }think she could use a special potion.} }Let me see here, 'Radiant Beauty'... No. }'Ray of Sunshine'... No, that's not it.} }Ah, here it is: 'Relax Frosty Bitch'. This }should help her out.}
OrmusIntroGossip1	38}You now speak to Ormus.} }He was once a great mage, but now }lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You }have questions for Ormus and doubt in }yourself. Ormus sees a strange }dichotomy in you... as he does in all }would-be heroes.} }Speak to him and he may grant you }wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and }seek wisdom in thyself.}

OrmusGossip3	52}How does one destroy Destruction? How }does one force Terror to flee in fear? }You have great tasks ahead of you, }Ormus thinks.}
OrmusGossip4	72}The Church of Light harbors the darkest }shadow of all. Tread lightly.}
OrmusGossip5	89}When speaking of the dead, it is best to }remain cryptic.}
OrmusGossip6	84}The Travincal can be breached by the }loss of one's wits, not by the use of }them.}
OrmusGossip7	95}Alkor is able to explain things much }more clearly than Ormus.}
OrmusGossip8	58}For one who spends so much time away }from home, Meshif has taken Kurast's }corruption the hardest.}
OrmusGossip9	91}Asheara is both proud and }self-conscious of her womanhood.}
OrmusGossip10	65}Deckard Cain... Ormus has no time for }the last son of the Horadrim. Pride led }that holy Order to failure.}
OrmusGossip11	63}Hratli suspects that Ormus is a mage. }He can suspect whatever he wants, }Ormus will not show him the true }magic.}
A3Q4Init1CainAct3	53}Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he }had a fondness for jade figurines. On }his trading voyages he collected an odd }assortment of such small statues.} }I would show him your figurine. }

A3Q4Init2MeshifAct3	73}Praise you! That jade figurine will }complete the set I was collecting.} }Here! I've had this statuette of a golden }bird for years, but I consider it a fair }exchange.}
A3Q4Init2Natalya	89}I'm having fun just watching you run }from place to place searching for a }Golden Bird. Some hero you are.}
A3Q4Init3CainAct3	47}I've read legends about a sage named }Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of }life beyond death.} }If I remember correctly, his ashes were }ensconced within a golden statuette. It }was a very strange tale.}
A3Q4Init3Hratli	134}You will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to }Alkor.}
A3Q4Init3Asheara	96}Such a beautiful statuette... But, you'd }think it would've been better cared for. }There's a compartment here that's full }o' dust.}
A3Q4AfterInitAlkor	73}Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank }you, my friend. } }Busy yourself while I experiment with }the ashes within it. Then, return and }see what I have made for you.}
A3Q4AfterInitOrmus	51}Ku Y'leh, in searching for immortal }youth, found only an early death. His }apprentices, seeking to live forever, }burned his body in order to derive }benefit from his ashes.}
A3Q4AfterInitHratli	50}Ku Y'leh was a powerful sage who was }rumored to have brewed a potion of }immortality. In an ironic twist of fate, }he was murdered before his potent }elixir could take effect.}
A3Q4AfterInitNatalya	78}Don't tell me you believe in all of that }'life after death' nonsense. You should }be more concerned with avoiding death }than making plans for after it finds }you.}
A3Q4SuccessfulAlkor	120}From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed }for you a potion.}
A3Q4SuccessfulMeshifAct3	94}Immortality is definitely not for me.} }Can you imagine having to wake up }every night just to piss for the next }thousand years?}
A3Q4SuccessfulCainAct3	63}So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all }along. I wonder if he knows what he }gave up for that jade figurine.}
A3Q4SuccessfulOrmus	54}Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh. }That venerable sage forgot that there }is no life beyond death. There is only }life.} }Once prolonged unnaturally, it can }become a living hell.}
A3Q4SuccessfulNatalya	67}I must admit, your foolish quest made }little sense to me. But now I see the }value of your actions. I believe you do }possess great wisdom.}
A3Q2InitCain	33}Never forget that your ultimate purpose }here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. }The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the }Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian }Tower that is located within the Temple }City of Travincal.} }Know this, friend. The only way to gain }entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy }the artifact known as the Compelling }Orb.} }Mephisto used this device to control the }Zakarum Priests and their followers. }The Orb can only be destroyed with an }ancient flail imbued with the spirit of }the one incorruptible priest.} }Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto }worked his evil corruption on the }Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to }his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the }Que-Hegan of the High Council.} }Mephisto directed the other Council }priests to slay and dismember Khalim }and then scatter his remains across }the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur }succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, }eventually becoming the embodiment of }Mephisto here on the mortal plane.} }The corrupted High Council fashioned }an Orb to control the rest of the }Zakarum faithful and used their powers }to hide the lair of their master from }mortals.} }Your task is to collect the scattered }relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, }and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric }Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his }relics.} }Once this is accomplished, you must }destroy the Compelling Orb with }Khalim's Will to open the way into the }corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.}
A3Q2EarlyReturnHeartCain	61}You have found Khalim's Heart, and it }still bears the courage to face }Mephisto!} }Place it in the Horadric Cube along with }Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the }Brain, and the Flail.}
A3Q2EarlyReturnEyeCain	52}Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal }the true path to Mephisto.} }Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube }along with Khalim's other relics - the }Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.}
A3Q2EarlyReturnBrainCain	58}This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain }knows Mephisto's weakness.} }Place it in the Horadric Cube along with }Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the }Heart, and the Flail.}
A3Q2EarlyReturnFlailCain	46}Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can }destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal }the way to Mephisto.} }Place it into the Horadric Cube along }with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his }Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute }them to carry out Khalim's Will.}
A3Q2SuccessfulCain	54}Masterfully done, hero! You have }crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to }destroy the Compelling Orb and open }the way to Mephisto. } }May the true Light guide your way.}
A3Q1InitAlkor	56}It pains me to waste time with you, so }I'll get right to the point.} }There is a very special book which you }must find for me. It was written long }ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who }studied Skatsimi magic and the effects }of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. }The Black Book was lost when the }Children of Zakarum took over this }land.} }Now, you must reclaim it without delay! }Its knowledge may aid us in this dark }time ahead.}
A3Q1AfterInitAlkor	73}The Black Book contains powerful }secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, }long eclipsed by Zakarum.} }I should warn you. The Black Book is }much sought after by both good and }evil. Be wary.}
A3Q1AfterInitOrmus	62}The Children of Zakarum believe that }the Black Book is filled with }blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book }may contain the secrets to our ultimate }redemption.}
A3Q1AfterInitMeshifAct3	73}Oh. No one really believes that the Black }Book exists. It's just a symbol of }Zakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.}
A3Q1AfterInitAsheara	102}Many things can be found in the city of }Kurast. The book may be there.}
A3Q1AfterInitHratli	54}We have long sought the Black Book of }Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts }spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you }find it, take it to Alkor.}
A3Q1AfterInitCainAct3	72}The Black Book is a powerful source of }information. The Zakarum will do }everything in their power to stop you }from obtaining it.}
A3Q1AfterInitNatalya	81}I've heard of the Black Book. My Order's }code is based on many of its passages. }If you find it, I will be greatly }impressed.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnAlkor	104}Did I neglect to mention that the book }contains useful information about the }Prime Evils?}
A3Q1EarlyReturnOrmus	55}Even if you find the sacred Book, you }must still traverse the jungle of }meaning within it. That journey could }prove to be far more perilous.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnMeshifAct3	56}Kurast was once the greatest city in the }world. Now it is hard to tell where the }jungle stops and the city begins. The }jungle grows rampant on the soil }enriched by the blood of my fellow }citizens.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnAsheara	68}I believe I can trust you now.} }When you first arrived, I suspected you }a spy for the Zakarum, the false }religion whose faithful are now under }the sway of a mysterious power. }They've made a mockery of the Old }Religion of Skatsim.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnHratli	62}Not getting much help?} }You know, people are like rugs. Hang }them out a window and shake 'em a }couple times. You'll be surprised how }much dirt comes out.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnCainAct3	81}I heard that there are ruined temples in }Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black }Book in one of them.}
A3Q1EarlyReturnNatalya	105}I hope you find the Black Book soon. I }could use something to read while I }wait for my orders.}
A3Q1SuccessfulAlkor	83}You have found the Book! It should give }all of us here some insight into the }nature of the Prime Evils...} }Ah, but as for you...}
A3Q1SuccessfulOrmus	70}Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like }a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape }of our future.}
A3Q1SuccessfulMeshifAct3	75}Thank all that's holy. You've returned }with the Black Book! Maybe now you }can put an end to the Evil that has }destroyed my homeland.}
A3Q1SuccessfulAsheara	135}The Iron Wolves are very impressed by }your skills.}
A3Q1SuccessfulHratli	74}We have the Book. Now we must see if }we can bear its revelations.}
A3Q1SuccessfulCainAct3	86}You have found a source of information }powerful enough to turn the tide }against the Zakarum.}
A3Q1SuccessfulNatalya	89}So, you've returned with the Book. You }surprise me. You must be very }resourceful.}
A3Q3InitHratli	45}As I told you before, I placed an }enchantment upon the dockside in }order to keep the demons at bay. But }lately, the enchantment seems to be }weakening.} }If memory serves me correctly, there is }a holy Skatsimi blade that could }revitalize the enchantment. The blade }is called the Gidbinn.} }Find it, and our sanctuary here will }remain safe.}
A3Q3AfterInitAlkor	66}Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? }Well, allow me to reduce your }ignorance on the subject.} }The Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a }religious artifact greatly valued by the }Old Religion, Skatsim.}
A3Q3AfterInitOrmus	64}Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But }how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact }aid an unbeliever like you?}
A3Q3AfterInitMeshifAct3	66}The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining }relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is }reputed to have great powers.}
A3Q3AfterInitAsheara	107}The Gidbinn will reinforce the }enchantments that protect the }dockside from the evil that infests }Kurast.}
A3Q3AfterInitHratli	54}As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the }possession of the Children of Light. }They do not wish it to fall into the }hands of those who can restore its }powers.} }You may not believe it, but Ormus is the }one who can use the Gidbinn to protect }us.}
A3Q3AfterInitCainAct3	55}I've done some research on the Taan }mage-clan, and it seems that most of }their magical studies were focused on }Skatsimi rites.} }If anyone is qualified to use the powers }of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.}
A3Q3AfterInitNatalya	73}Don't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. }Though it is only a small dagger, it }holds tremendous power when in the }hands of a true Skatsimi mage.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnAlkor	70}Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests }placed great power within the small }blade. Power enough to repel this }terrible jungle-curse which encroaches }on our sanctuary.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnOrmus	83}If we are to have peace from the }shadow, you must find the weapon }which will destroy the Light.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnMeshifAct3	67}The jungle is like nothing you've ever }seen before. Imagine Paradise }festering like a wound... then bursting!}
A3Q3EarlyReturnAsheara	145}I'm certain that the Gidbinn is very }closely guarded.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnHratli	70}Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will }use it to strengthen the protective }barrier around the dockside.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnCainAct3	75}Since you haven't come across the }Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper }in the jungle nearer Kurast.}
A3Q3EarlyReturnNatalya	97}You'd best get back out there and find }that blade. The jungle creeps further }into this camp by the hour.}
A3Q3SuccessfulAlkor	77}Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade }from right under Zakarum's nose! This }is a great day, indeed!}
A3Q3SuccessfulOrmus	41}You have done well, noble hero. Ormus }congratulates you. The old spirits of }Skatsim will watch over you for }returning their sacred blade.} }Now, after all these years, Ormus will }once again use his powers to protect }the innocent from the shadow. The }spell that protects the dockside shall }now be reinforced.}
A3Q3SuccessfulMeshifAct3	79}With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will }grant us revenge upon the powers that }ravaged this land.}
A3Q3SuccessfulAsheara	99}Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are }needed to guard the dockside, some of }them have volunteered to accompany }you free of charge.}
A3Q3SuccessfulHratli	80}The Gidbinn's magic can only be }channeled through Ormus.} }Take it to him. He has the necessary }knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi }magics.}
A3Q3SuccessfulCainAct3	62}Who could have foreseen that the Old }Religion would play such an effective }role in our war against the Three? }Again, your efforts amaze me, my }friend.}
A3Q3SuccessfulNatalya	67}You are truly amazing, stranger. There }are precious few items in the world }that would tempt me to go up against }the Children of Zakarum and their }midget minions.}
A3Q3RewardOrmus	101}This magic ring does me no good.} }Here... Wear it proudly!}
A3Q5InitOrmus	36}You have done well, my friend. Your }courage and valor are an inspiration to }us all.} }But now the time has come to face }those responsible for the evil that has }stifled our land. You must destroy the }High Council of Zakarum!} }Long ago, these elders were charged }with the stewardship of Mephisto, the }Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned }within the Guardian Tower.} }Through the generations, these pious }men slowly fell more and more under }the sway of Mephisto's malevolent }power and the Council became an evil }mockery of its former glory. } }It is Mephisto's Hatred that has }corrupted Zakarum and turned its }devout followers into paranoid }fanatics. That is why you must travel }to the Temple City of Travincal and }slay the Council.} }Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold }over this land and its people will be }broken!}
A3Q5AfterInitAlkor	84}The Black Book contains some vague }prophecies regarding this undertaking. }I'm not so sure it will turn out well for }you.}
A3Q5AfterInitAlkorVA	90}I am but a potion dealer and an avid }reader of occult books. What do I know }of the Travincal?}
A3Q5AfterInitOrmus	54}You must know that the Guardian Tower }in the Temple City was built by the }Horadrim for one purpose - to hold }Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, }you may enter the Tower.}
A3Q5AfterInitOrmusVA	54}You must know that the Guardian Tower }in the Temple City was built by the }Horadrim for one purpose -  to hold }Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, }you may enter the Tower.}
A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3	68}There is only one way to the Temple }City. You will have to cross many rivers }and streams, but you'll find it. A great }tower stands at its center.}
A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3VA	113}It has been said that Ormus speaks }most clearly when his ideas are utterly }mad.}
A3Q5AfterInitAsheara	89}The Children of Zakarum who guard the }Tower square can be killed, but their }numbers are vast. You must destroy }their Council.}
A3Q5AfterInitAshearaVA	105}There are many zealots among the }followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult }to get past them.}
A3Q5AfterInitHratli	104}Remember. You can always find }sanctuary here with us.}
A3Q5AfterInitHratliVA	75}This has been a trying time for all of us, }but I sense this nightmare is coming to }an end.}
A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3	63}Ormus tells me that the Council is }comprised of tremendously powerful }priests. It will be difficult to best them.}
A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3VA	93}The Temple City is well guarded. You'd }best keep your wits about you.}
A3Q5AfterInitNatalya	100}You are incredibly brave to venture into }the lion's den. I wish you luck.}
A3Q5AfterInitNatalyaVA	95}Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their }fanaticism is their greatest weapon.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkor	111}Kill as many as you can. I have a }morbid love of excess.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkorVA	91}If only we could have found the Black }Book. I feel as though a malevolent }hand has led us away from it.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnOrmus	49}If you die on this quest, I will }commemorate your sacrifice in an epic }poem. You will not need a potion to }achieve immortality. Ormus' words will }do that.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3	110}Within the Temple City is a courtyard. }The Council resides there.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA	107}I have heard rumors that the Prime }Evils are here seeking their Brother.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnAsheara	161}The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready }to aid you.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnAshearaVA	139}Things are getting wilder than Ladies }Night at the Slippery Fist.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnHratli	65}The followers of Zakarum demand }complete allegiance to their creed. }They have slaughtered many of their }own for minor grievances.} }They will not hesitate to kill you.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnHratliVA	75}After having served Mephisto all these }years, the Council must be twisted by }hatred and evil.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnCainAct3	81}Sankekur may be using a Compelling }Orb to control the minds of the }Children of Zakarum.}
A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalya	80}I respect your need to do this. Honor }demands that you see this through. Yet }your chances are so slim...}
A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalyaVA	80}I respect your need to do this. Honor }demands that you see this through. Yet }your chances are so slim...}
A3Q5SuccessfulAlkor	91}You've accomplished the impossible! By }killing the Council, the curse of }Zakarum will be lifted and our land will }be free!} }Oh. Thank you!}
A3Q5SuccessfulOrmus	40}Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You }have broken the long, dark reign of }Zakarum and delivered the first }paralyzing blow against the Three.} }Yet still, the true test lies ahead. For he }whom the Council guarded still lives }within the Blackened Tower.}
A3Q5SuccessfulMeshifAct3	76}It seems the jungle is already dying }back. You've broken the curse, my }friend! May the Light bless you!}
A3Q5SuccessfulAsheara	125}The sun has set on the Religion of Light.}
A3Q5SuccessfulHratli	68}The followers of Zakarum lacked all }sense of moderation. The collapse of }their tainted religion gives me hope.}
A3Q5SuccessfulCainAct3	48}Ridding Kurast of the Council of }Zakarum was essential. Still, there is }more you must do. The Compelling Orb, }too, must be destroyed.} }Diablo and Baal must be close to finding }their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've }no time to waste.}
A3Q5SuccessfulNatalya	88}I can hardly believe you did it. Your }power blankets you like a shining aura.}
A3Q6InitOrmus	53}Diablo and Baal have surely found the }Temple City by now. They seek to free }their Brother, Mephisto, who was }imprisoned by the Horadrim in the }Temple's Guardian Tower.} }You must reach him before his Brothers }do and prevent them from releasing }Hatred upon the world.}
A3Q6AfterInitAlkor	90}The hidden ways of the Tower are long }forgotten. Though... it is rumored to }have been built as far below the }ground as above it.}
A3Q6AfterInitAlkorVA	114}We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure }of his Brothers' whereabouts.}
A3Q6AfterInitOrmus	52}Make haste! Though the Three are sure }to reunite, it is uncertain as to what }they have planned once they do.} }Be cautious, my friend. Though you are }mighty, no mortal can stand alone }against the power of the Prime Evils.}
A3Q6AfterInitOrmusVA	52}Make haste! Though the Three are sure }to reunite, it is uncertain as to what }they have planned once they do.} }Be cautious, my friend. Though you are }mighty, no mortal can stand alone }against the power of the Prime Evils.}
A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3	66}Be careful when you return to the }Tower. Though many of the followers }of Zakarum have fled, there's no telling }what horrors still lurk inside it.}
A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3VA	116}Move quickly, my friend, and end this }curse once and for all!}
A3Q6AfterInitAsheara	60}I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a }scouting mission into the jungle near }the Temple City... They encountered }two cloaked men who attacked them }with horrifying powers.} }My men barely survived. I have to }assume that the two strangers are }Diablo and Baal.} }You'd better hurry. They're close to }finding their brother.}
A3Q6AfterInitAshearaVA	93}Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in }Travincal. The Evil is still strong there.}
A3Q6AfterInitHratli	43}Mephisto, along with Baal, was }originally captured in the desert near }Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the }Brothers together was far too }dangerous.} }The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower }to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came }to power in this land, it took over the }Temple City without paying any heed to }what was locked within the Tower.} }And it became their doom.}
A3Q6AfterInitHratliVA	73}I hear there is a little family reunion }about to take place in Kurast. The }Three brothers draw close.}
A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3	116}You must reach Mephisto before his }brothers do.}
A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3VA	50}The ancient Horadrim always feared }that the Three would escape their }prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, }the last of their Order, have seen it }come to pass.} }You are the only one who can prevent }this, my friend. The final hour draws }near.}
A3Q6AfterInitNatalya	75}Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't }give in to your hatred. That is his }greatest weapon against you.}
A3Q6AfterInitNatalyaVA	75}Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't }give in to your hatred. That is his }greatest weapon against you.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkor	68}Well, the good news is that events are }unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. }The bad news is that the story ends in }our utter ruin!}
A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkorVA	80}I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of }elixir preclude me from answering.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmus	59}I understand that the great Patriarch of }Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies }Mephisto.} }You must overcome Hatred lest Terror }and Destruction claim us all!}
A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmusVA	77}I am loath to describe what will happen }if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3	110}I ought to return to the ship. We may }have to sail from here very quickly.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA	110}I ought to return to the ship. We may }have to sail from here very quickly.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnAsheara	80}The sudden reduction in our ranks }makes us eager to destroy Diablo and }his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron }Wolves!}
A3Q6EarlyReturnAshearaVA	200}We will fight to the death.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnHratli	58}Why build a Tower to place the beast }below ground? At times I believe the }Horadrim lacked common sense.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnHratliVA	106}Shouldn't you be running frantically up }and down stairs about now?}
A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3	96}Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto }must not escape.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3VA	96}Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto }must not escape.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalya	55}Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the }most powerful mortal in the world. He }controls thousands of fanatical }worshippers and embodies the Lord of }Hatred, himself. His death will be no }easy task.}
A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalyaVA	55}Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the }most powerful mortal in the world. He }controls thousands of fanatical }worshippers and embodies the Lord of }Hatred himself. His death will be no }easy task.}
A3Q6SuccessfulAlkor	71}Your news is great indeed. You have }saved us all. I would smile, but I'm }afraid my face might collapse.}
A3Q6SuccessfulOrmus	48}You have defeated a Prime Evil in }combat. Ormus is impressed beyond }words. But staying here will not end }this conflict.} }You must enter the Infernal Gate and }stop Diablo once and for all.}
A3Q6SuccessfulMeshifAct3	70}Ahh... Now, Kurast can begin the task }of rekindling its former glory... I thank }you.}
A3Q6SuccessfulAsheara	65}Well done, my friend. You are a great }champion of Order. Please, consider }yourself an honorary Iron Wolf.}
A3Q6SuccessfulHratli	121}It looks like you're going to Hell before }me.} }Put in a good word.}
A3Q6SuccessfulCainAct3	42}Our faith in you was well deserved. But }Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it }is likely that Baal followed him there.} }Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord }of Terror before all is lost. Only then }will our world be saved!}
A3Q6SuccessfulNatalya	55}Word is spreading fast that you killed }Mephisto. I'd be honored to fight }beside you in Hell, but I've just received }my mission orders.} }I'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands }of the North, but I can't tell you why. }With luck, our paths will cross again. }Farewell.}
TyraelActIntroGossip1	43}It is good to see you again, hero.} }Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for }the Light. I knew that you would }eventually find your way here. The }Pandemonium Fortress is the last }bastion of Heaven's power before the }Gates of the Burning Hells.} }This place has been hallowed by the }blood of thousands of champions of }the Light, many of whom were mortal, }like yourself. Now the final battle }against the Prime Evils draws near... }and you must face it alone. } }I have been forbidden to aid you }directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. }For this is the hour of mortal Man's }triumph...your triumph.} }May the Light protect you and the }powers of Heaven shine upon your }path...}
TyraelAct4Gossip1	62}Long ago, I swore an oath to watch }over the Horadrim and their }descendants.} }As Deckard Cain is the last of their }esteemed Order, I will not allow him to }perish here so far from the lands of his }birth.} }Be at ease, hero, I know that he is your }friend. He shall come to no harm.}
CainAct4IntroGossip1	41}Can you believe this place? Did you ever }dare to dream that you'd one day }stand upon the crossroads between }Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium }Fortress is truly miraculous.} }However, your journey is not yet over. }Diablo still roams free in Hell, }marshalling his demonic forces. Only }when he is beaten will our world finally }have peace.} }Hurry now... the sands of time slow for }no one! }
CainAct4Gossip1	48}I have read much about the enigmatic }Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in }Horadrim lore both for his compassion }for mortals and his unquenchable }spirit.} }It was rumored that he went against the }wishes of Heaven and gave the }Horadrim the original Soulstones in }order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.}
HellsAngelGossip1	72}Halt! Before venturing into Diablo's lair, }go to the Hellforge with Mephisto's }Soulstone.} }Place the stone on the Hellforge and }use the Hellforge Hammer to destroy }it.}
HellsAngelGossip2	66}Proceed, hero, into Terror's lair.} }Know that Diablo's innermost sanctum }is hidden by five seals.} }Only by opening each of these seals can }you clear your way to the final battle.}
A4Q1InitTyrael	42}There is a dark, tortured soul who was }trapped within this forsaken realm long }ago. He was called Izual by mortal }men, and in ages past he was my most }trusted Lieutenant.} }Yet, against my wishes he led an }ill-fated assault upon the fiery }Hellforge, itself.} }Despite his valor and strength, Izual }was captured by the Prime Evils and }twisted by their perverse power. They }forced him to betray his own kind and }give up Heaven's most guarded }secrets.} }He became a corrupt shadow of his }former self - a fallen angel trusted }neither by Heaven nor Hell.} }For his transgressions, Izual's spirit }was bound within the form of a terrible }creature which was summoned from }the Abyss. His maddened spirit has }resided within that tortured husk for }many ages now.} }It seems to me that he has suffered }long enough. I implore you, hero, find }Izual and release him from his cruel }imprisonment.} }Put an end to his guilt and suffering.}
A4Q1AfterInitTyrael	59}Though Izual no longer carries the }Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may }still possess great strength and power }within his new form.} }Also, he may not be able to tell friend }from foe while in his present state. If }you find him, he will almost certainly be }hostile.} }Proceed with the utmost caution.}
A4Q1AfterInitCain	54}Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual }the Fallen? He must have great faith in }your abilities!} }I trust you know what you're doing... Be }careful. You're our last hope.}
A4Q1EarlyReturnTyrael	75}You mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual }must be put to rest, but Diablo still }lurks within this realm.} }Go now... Hurry!}
A4Q1EarlyReturnCain	83}Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, }eh?} }You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel }like some great evil is permeating the }air around here.}
A4Q1SuccessfulIzual	47}Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me!} }You see, it was I who told Diablo and his }Brothers about the Soulstones and how }to corrupt them. It was I who helped }the Prime Evils mastermind their own }exile to your world.} }The plan we set in motion so long ago }cannot be stopped by any mortal }agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill }forth into your world like a tidal wave }of blood and nightmares.} }You and all your kind... are doomed.}
A4Q1SuccessfulTyrael	53}Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's }tortured spirit to rest. May the Light }protect you and the powers of Heaven }shine upon your path.} }But, if what you tell me is true, then I }fear that we have been played for fools }all along.} }Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers }trick me into using the Soulstones }against them... Now the Stones' powers }are corrupted.} }With the combined powers of the }Soulstones under their control, the }Prime Evils will be able to turn the }mortal world into a permanent outpost }of Hell!}
A4Q1SuccessfulCain	68}You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is }imperative that you find and stop }Diablo!} }You should speak of this with Tyrael. He }will know what to make of this.}

EnterDOEAma	I hear foul creatures about.
EnterDOEBar	There are many foes here.
EnterDOEPal	Evil Dwells within this cave.
EnterDOESor	This place is trouble.
EnterDOENec	I sense death within this place.
EnterBurialAma	I sense great sorrow and misery.
EnterBurialBar	I shall meet death head-on.
EnterBurialPal	This holy place has been desecrated!
EnterBurialSor	There is dark magic at work here.
EnterBurialNec	Too many empty graves.
EnterMonasteryAma	So, this is the site of Andariel's atrocities.
EnterMonasteryBar	The Monastery reeks with evil and corruption.
EnterMonasteryPal	Even the Light cannot pierce this gloom.
EnterMonasterySor	Ah, the Monastery... Andariel's stronghold!
EnterMonasteryNec	This place has the stench of demons about it.
EnterForgottenTAma	What's that smell?
EnterForgottenTBar	The stench of poison...
EnterForgottenTPal	This tower shall be cleansed of evil.
EnterForgottenTSor	This place holds many secrets.
EnterForgottenTNec	This place reeks of death.
EnterJailAma	What nightmarish tortures took place here?
EnterJailBar	No one should ever be caged.
EnterJailPal	This is no place for a warrior to die.
EnterJailSor	If there was magic here, it's long gone now.
EnterJailNec	Ah, the slow torture of caged starvation.

EnterCatacombsAma	This place is eerie.
EnterCatacombsBar	So cold and damp under the earth.
EnterCatacombsPal	There is great evil here.
EnterCatacombsSor	This place chills me to the bone.
EnterCatacombsNec	I sense a demonic presence here.
CompletingDOEAma	Perhaps now the Sisters will trust me.
CompletingDOEBar	The Rogues are safe for the moment.
CompletingDOEPal	My duty here is done.
CompletingDOESor	This cave has been purged of evil.
CompletingDOENec	Is that enough to earn the Rogues' trust?
CompletingBurialAma	Rest in peace, Sister.
CompletingBurialBar	Good riddance, Blood Raven.
CompletingBurialPal	Sisters, there was no other way.
CompletingBurialSor	Rest now, Blood Raven.
CompletingBurialNec	Blood Raven... rest well.
FindingInifusAma	What a strange-looking tree...
FindingInifusBar	This tree is one of a kind.
FindingInifusPal	This tree bristles with magic!
FindingInifusSor	This ancient tree has an aura of magic about it.
FindingInifusNec	This tree shines with inner spirits.
FindingCairnAma	These stones serve some magical purpose...
FindingCairnBar	These magic stones are ancient.
FindingCairnPal	Maybe Akara could dispel the mystery of these stones.
FindingCairnSor	These stones radiate powerful magic.
FindingCairnNec	I sense many spirits around the stones.
FindingTristramAma	It's as if a great war were fought here.
FindingTristramBar	The land here is dead and lifeless.
FindingTristramPal	What a tragic end to Tristram!
FindingTristramSor	Tristram was no match for Diablo's fury.
FindingTristramNec	All that's left of proud Tristram are ghosts and ashes.
RescueCainAma	Deckard Cain, go to the Rogues' camp without delay!
RescueCainBar	Deckard Cain, you've got to get out of here!
RescueCainPal	Deckard Cain, leave quickly!
RescueCainSor	Deckard Cain, get to the Rogue camp!
RescueCainNec	Deckard Cain, if you value your life, leave here immediately.
HoradricMalusAma	The Sisters will be glad to have this back!
HoradricMalusBar	I should take this to Charsi.
HoradricMalusPal	This will help the Sisters turn the tide against evil.
HoradricMalusSor	I hope the Sisters appreciate this thing...
HoradricMalusNec	All this for a hammer?
CompletingForgottenTAma	The Tower's trove... for the taking!
CompletingForgottenTBar	This is reward enough!
CompletingForgottenTPal	I've earned the right to this abandoned trove.
CompletingForgottenTSor	I hope to find other such treasures!
CompletingForgottenTNec	Treasure hunting... bah... Treasure finding... yes.
CompletingAndarielAma	This Maiden shall inflict no more anguish.
CompletingAndarielBar	Let the gate be opened!
CompletingAndarielPal	My work here is finished.
CompletingAndarielSor	The evil queen has fallen.
CompletingAndarielNec	Back to the hell that spawned you, Andariel.
EnteringRadamentAma	This place disgusts me.
EnteringRadamentBar	Ugh... The tell-tale stench of a carnivore's lair.
EnteringRadamentPal	The foul stench of evil assails me.
EnteringRadamentSor	I sense strange magic here.
EnteringRadamentNec	I sense a powerful undead being within this place.
CompletingRadamentAma	Atma has been avenged.
CompletingRadamentBar	I've just about had my fill of the walking dead.
CompletingRadamentPal	I pray that Atma will rest easy now.
CompletingRadamentSor	What a misguided monster.
CompletingRadamentNec	What a waste of undead flesh.
BeginTaintedSunAma	Great. An eclipse. This just keeps getting better and better.
BeginTaintedSunBar	What is wrong with the sun?
BeginTaintedSunPal	What Evil taints the light of the sun?
BeginTaintedSunSor	Only powerful magic can conjure an eclipse.
BeginTaintedSunNec	Only the darkest magics can turn the sun black.
EnteringClawViperAma	I hope I know what I'm doing!
EnteringClawViperBar	The sun has never shone here!
EnteringClawViperPal	Light guide my way in this accursed place.
EnteringClawViperSor	I sense strong magic within this place.
EnteringClawViperNec	This place is as dark as a tomb.
CompletingTaintedSunAma	Let there be light.
CompletingTaintedSunBar	It is good to know that the sun shines once again.
CompletingTaintedSunPal	The Light can never be extinguished by evil.
CompletingTaintedSunSor	Who would have thought that such primitive beings could cause so much trouble!
CompletingTaintedSunNec	What a pity. I was beginning to enjoy the darkness.
EnteringArcaneAma	Am I the first to find this Arcane fortress?
EnteringArcaneBar	One could get lost in here.
EnteringArcanePal	This surely is the product of a twisted mind!
EnteringArcaneSor	This place actually... distorts reality. Fascinating.
EnteringArcaneNec	This is fantastic! I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension.
FindingSummonerAma	What a freak!
FindingSummonerBar	Stand aside, old fool. I have no time for your babblings.
FindingSummonerPal	Surely the evil here has driven you mad.
FindingSummonerSor	Is this truly Horazon?
FindingSummonerNec	This bumbling fool cannot be the mighty Horazon!
CompletingSummonerAma	Good riddance, freak.
CompletingSummonerBar	I hate staining my hands with the blood of foul sorcerers.
CompletingSummonerPal	Rest in peace, tortured soul.
CompletingSummonerSor	That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch.
CompletingSummonerNec	He was not Horazon. He was a deluded fool who got too close to true power!
FindingdecoyTombAma	This has got to be the right place.
FindingdecoyTombBar	This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place.
FindingdecoyTombPal	Is this the tomb I seek?
FindingdecoyTombSor	This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb?
FindingdecoyTombNec	This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here.
FindingTrueTombAma	Should I enter...?  Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap...
FindingTrueTombBar	Such a cold breeze... Tal Rasha must be kept here.
FindingTrueTombPal	Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice.
FindingTrueTombSor	This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha!
FindingTrueTombNec	I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside.
CompletingTombAma	This is not good. Will this madness ever end?
CompletingTombBar	I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy.
CompletingTombPal	I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils.
CompletingTombSor	Diablo and Baal have escaped me!  Next time... vengeance!
CompletingTombNec	I came too late. Now... Destruction is let loose upon the world once more.
nodarkwanderer	Not in Game
FindingLamEsenAma	I hope the secrets within this book can help us.
FindingLamEsenBar	I hope this book is worth all the trouble.
FindingLamEsenPal	The Black Book... It's heresy to the Zakarum High Council.
FindingLamEsenSor	This tome has the weight of knowledge about it.
FindingLamEsenNec	This ancient book radiates arcane power!
CompletingLamEsenAma	All this trouble over a tattered book.
CompletingLamEsenBar	May this book lift the shadow from Kurast.
CompletingLamEsenPal	May the Black Book deliver us from evil!
CompletingLamEsenSor	May the Black Book bring a black day to hell!
CompletingLamEsenNec	Once the book has served its purpose, I shall delve into its secrets.
FindingBeneathCityAma	Whoa.... What died down here?
FindingBeneathCityBar	Cough... The stench down here is choking!
FindingBeneathCityPal	The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me.
FindingBeneathCitySor	It smells worse than rotting reagents down here.
FindingBeneathCityNec	It's been years since I waded through sewers for fun.
FindingDrainLeverAma	I hope this does something good...
FindingDrainLeverBar	This will drain out some of the filth.
FindingDrainLeverPal	This appears to control the ancient valves.
FindingDrainLeverSor	This looks promising.
FindingDrainLeverNec	This looks like what I've been searching for.
CompletingBeneathCityAma	Eureka!
CompletingBeneathCityBar	Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air!
CompletingBeneathCityPal	This trove will help lift the curse from Kurast!
CompletingBeneathCitySor	I hope these items can aid me against the demons.
CompletingBeneathCityNec	Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer...
CompletingBladeAma	This dagger will separate the faithful from the fallen.
CompletingBladeBar	This holy blade does not belong in the hands of the Zakarum.
CompletingBladePal	This blade shall pierce the heart of evil!
CompletingBladeSor	I must take this to Ormus.
CompletingBladeNec	This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it.
FindingJadeFigAma	What would this bring from the right buyer?
FindingJadeFigAma	What a strange little statue.
FindingJadeFigAma	Perhaps I could trade this for something more valuable?
FindingJadeFigAma	I don't sense any magic about this item. Very strange.
FindingJadeFigAma	A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better.
FindingTempleAma	Such a dark temple for a Religion of Light...
FindingTempleBar	The spirits of nature have fled this dreaded place.
FindingTemplePal	This corrupted temple was once the shining heart of my religion...
FindingTempleSor	I sense tremendous evil within this place.
FindingTempleNec	This temple exudes darkness.
CompletingTempleAma	Skatsim's reign is renewed!
CompletingTempleBar	The dark powers here will no longer poison the land.
CompletingTemplePal	The Temple shall shine anew with the Light.
CompletingTempleSor	The Temple's power is annulled.
CompletingTempleNec	The Temple's dark power is broken.
FindingGuardianTowerAma	This must be where Mephisto is.
FindingGuardianTowerBar	The final resting place of Hatred itself.
FindingGuardianTowerPal	This must be where the Horadrim imprisoned Mephisto.
FindingGuardianTowerSor	Ah... Mephisto's prison.
FindingGuardianTowerNec	The Tower that holds Mephisto....
CompletingGuardianTowerAma	Success... But still there's something not right.
CompletingGuardianTowerBar	Maybe now the world will have peace.
CompletingGuardianTowerPal	The Lord of Hatred shall darken the world no longer.
CompletingGuardianTowerSor	Mephisto shall no longer darken our souls with hatred.
CompletingGuardianTowerNec	Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss.
FreezingIzualAma	Wait... Don't I get three wishes?
FreezingIzualBar	Even Fallen Angels deserve freedom.
FreezingIzualPal	How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness?
FreezingIzualSor	He was corrupted to the core. I pity him.
FreezingIzualNec	Bah! Izual was weak. He squandered his infernal power.
